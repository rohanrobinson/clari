 
 Good morning. 
 You are back stuck with me  again.
 I believe our schedule shows  we have a couple
 more guests, I think one  more.
 From the Department of Energy 
 and before that was with the  NSA
 and she touches on many  things
 related to AI 
 being leveraged 
 to help defend and operate 
 critical infrastructure. 
 And then a few days after  that,
 I believe it is my turn to  talk about
 probably be 
 a Deist topic of the class 
 which is a Thomas weapons 
 -- 
 autonomous weapons. 
 A couple of good  presentations there,
 any thoughts or comments on  our recent guests?
 Did (Name) light your fire? 
 She usually does. 
 So, 
 today let's give some thought 
 to how we actually go about  doing this stuff.
 How do we actually begin 
 to define what we want 
 AI or a cognitive system to  do.
 At the moment, 
 we see a problem and we aim  AI audit
 and we do it, simple as that. 
 Very specialized, 
 there is no Star Wars AI 
 where you just asking  questions
 or in 2001, 
 it plays chess as well as  runs the ship.
 This is the first time we  are really talking about
 why artificial general  intelligence is hard.
 Just from your own projects, 
 just building a chat bot 
 should have given you a  taste for \'96
 this is an easy. 
 It is easy to do for the  assignment
 but to do it on a big scale, 
 that might be tough. 
 Like the Georgia Tech chat  bot
 that did the intro to  programming
 (unknown term) office hours. 
 That was pretty tricky. 
 Before we can really get  started on a particular 
problem, we have to  understand what the problem 
is.  How do you decide if you want 
to pull a little AI or a  prediction machine to help?
 Has anybody ever asked  someone else
 how to solve a problem? 
 Like a grandma's recipe for  biscuits?
 I see a couple of nodding  heads.
 Did grandma fully described 
 everything that goes into  making those biscuits?
 Some of my older relatives 
 would say that it is a  handful,
 what's that? 
 The whole concept of fresh, 
 fresh greens to one person 
 might mean that they just  got home from the grocer
 but to Granny, it is just 
 that she brought them in  from outside.
 Do you wash the greens that  you buy from the co-op?
 You probably should 
 but in the past, you  absolutely did because
 they were covered with dirt  and bugs and everything.
 There is another story 
 about a gentleman asking 
 his partner 
 why, when preparing a pot  roast,
 she always cut off both ends? 
. 
 Thinking maybe there was some 
 preservative or some weird  thing.
 And she didn't really know,  she said that that was how 
she had been taught and they  trace that back to her 
grandmother, who happened to  have a very short
 (Indiscernible). 
 She just decided to cut off  one end.
 We need to understand why 
 we have always done it this  way.
 Projects at IBM, 
 try to pull a little AI over  it
, bring a cognitive system to  bear,
 it is hard to get these  answers.
 It is hard to find out \'96 
 how do you do it? 
 Now go to the extreme. 
 Ask the oncologist, 
 how did you decide to use  drug A instead of drug B?
 This is tough. 
 And they don't always want  to tell you, even if they 
know.  So part of our challenge
 in bringing AI to our company 
 is to understand what  problems make sense and what 
problems don't.  That is what these three 
chapters are all about, is  how do you decide
 where to do this and how do  you decide if it worked?
 So Georgia Tech, 
 how did they evaluate? 
 At the end of the term, 
 they ask all of the students  \'96
 which TA's were most health  will?
 There is no context, and  happened to be the AI.
 Our TA 
 is excellent. 
 If you had had any  interactions with him,
 and we are not criticizing  him because he is good,
 could any of those have been  handled by
 a nontrivial cognitive  system?
 Hmm. 
 What about a less clear  question?
 Some of you probably have  academic advisors
 helping you guide your  degree program.
 Could that be a cognitive  system?
 How do you measure success  there?
 It is going to take a while,  right,
. 
 You have to wait until Tracy  has the senior management job 
at Facebook 
 before we know whether the  guidance she got from Prof X 
work.  The book earlier talked about
 predicting the  counterfactual.
 Remember that? 
 Suppose I don't take CS 89, 
 will I be adversely impacted  when I get a job
 at Twitter 
 or maybe at Enron? 
 Maybe. 
 All of these things have to  go into a decision to deploy 
something like this because  it is not trivial. You have 
to not only find and  understand how a process
 is being done today, you  also have to put
 understand where we could do  it better.
 You usually do pieces and  parts,
 which brings its own  complications.
 How is 
 success or failure measured  in a process?
 You took the quiz and you  got 100, boom, measure.
 You wash the dishes, 
 you take out a microscope 
 with bacteria stains, 
 you look to see if you left  anything on
 and how do you measure this? 
 If you can't, how could a I? 
 Distilling how you make  these decisions,
 what is the outcome that you  really want?
 We talked about ways a lot  in the book.
 What is 
 (Name)'s goal? 
 Directions 
, avoiding traffic, 
 warning you of previously  reported
 issues on the road, 
 including speed traps 
 and stopped vehicles. 
 The AI just reports the  things on the road
 because 
 many people reported 
 if there is a deer on the  road trying to eat the grass,
 or a pothole on the left,  that sort of thing.
 Is the AI just making this  up?
 Probably (Laughs) 
 It depends. 
 Does it build a history 
 of reports from Charles? 
 Yes, they do. 
 They keep track of that  stuff.
 You have little indicators 
 that show your 
 (unknown term) or something  like that.
 That is cool, 
 but it also gives them away 
 to determine how much 
 you can listen to this  particular person.
 Is this person always about 
 1/2 a mile late and  reporting it because they 
can't talk?  Or because they had to pull 
over so that they could type  legally.
 So we have to be able to  measure this stuff
 and we have to know what we  are trying to do
 before we consider trying to  measure something.
 I just said hey 
 followed by that word Siri, 
 and my phone went on. 
 Careful about that. 
 Let's wake everybody up, 
 what are the motivations 
 \'96 
 what sort of situation 
 do you think you would  encounter
 after you graduate and  you're working,
 what kind of situation would  you encounter
 that would make you want to  do AI?
 
 I guess I kind of try to  predict more of your question
 that I was able to buy 
 I was going to give the  example of
 a similar process to the  foreign example in the book
.  Where there are
 processes that involve lots  of people and sort of 
sequential steps, and AI's  even if they don't necessarily
 do work to 
 done by people, 
 they can improve the process  by optimizing the inputs
 to different lines of people. 
 So I process can get 
 held up 
 if 
 -- 
 the purchase order needs to  be validated,
 so it is not necessarily  doing the job that human does
 by making their job easier. 
 
 Yes, that's right. 
 
 In this day and time, 
 they usually want data to  back up their reasoning when 
someone asked for my opinion. 
 So AI can help us with data  analysis and gathering lots 
of data, and helping us  create those conclusions that 
logical reasoning behind them. 
 
 It is not always logical, 
 think to the 
 (unknown term) the baseball  team.
 How about, 
 have you ever heard anyone  say that they have always 
done it that way?  (Laughs)
 
 Not on the Dartmouth thing  that you mentioned
 but 
 I was just thinking of the  Project Debater
. 
 Where I forget the authors  name
 but he was talking about how  their system
 looks through 4 million  articles
 for a certain topic 
 and maybe 
 if someone asked me for my  opinion
 because I think having 
 those key points that it has 
 would let me know to what  extent my opinion is biased
 because I come from a  certain place. Maybe the 
system and bias so that way I  would know
 whether for certain issues,  I feel more strongly than 
others because I'm affected  in a certain way. So that 
would be one interesting way  to find out
 what points the AI think are  important and what points I 
 What would you do 

 I would maybe think about  where the AI was biased in 
itself because as we read, 
 there is also a significant  issue with AI itself.
 But I would maybe take some  time to think about whether 
or not my opinion is  inherently biased
 or whether I have some 
 game and this whole  situation,
 which is what governs my  decision
 as opposed to me being a  neutral third party.
 Yes, and that is  tricky to
o 
 because these cognitive  systems are going to make 
suggestions, 
 whether it is for  investments, medical choices,
 or should you adopt that  puppy.
 Why should we build them if  no one is going to think
 -- take their advice? 
 That is driving the  expandability thing too.
 Why should I take vitamin C  every day?
 Kind of in that vein, 
 I did some very basic 
 looking into the open scale  tutorial
. 
 It brings up an interesting  question
 where there is the ability  to think in more
 basic and nonmarital methods, 
 you can see how individual  factors
 contribute in a machine  learning way to the outcome.
 If you unbiased data or  model,
 it requires prioritization 
 of outcomes 
 because you can actually get  better performance
 if you include some of the  factors
 like in the open scale  example
 or the auto AI one. 
 With sex and age 
 because those are useful to  the model
. 
 In a certain way, you have  compliance considerations
 but maybe if there is less 
 black and white examples 
 of ways you can sort of  settle
 -- subtly discriminate, it  doesn't have to be people 
against inputs, you actually  have to consider training of 
performance for inputs 
 into the model that aren't  necessarily desirable
 or you think should not be  considered.
 Well said. 
 That is a big challenge 
 and I believe we will be  talking about it some more 
before the end of the term.  It is all about trade-offs.
 The AI Assistant at Georgia  Tech,
 it was a gamble 
 but the trade-off was, 
 that we are going to hope it  gives good answers
 and we are going to monitor  it and see what happens.
 We are trading off  performance and 24/7
 in exchange for potential 
 wrong answers 
 or inconsistent answers. 
 So you have to weigh that. 
 You mentioned data, the more  data you have the more 
accurate you are going to  get. Conceivably.
 But then you have to worry  about bias, as you said.
 Performance.  You want it to be fast,
 if you have an app that  identifies Poison Ivy,
 you do not wanted to take  five minutes. (Laughs)
 If you're going to continue  your height, you need to know.
 If you don't have the time 
 and you really have to make  it fast,
 then you have to decide 
 what is your goal here or  what is your payoff?
 Very conservative, missed a  few,
 the very opposite of  conservative
 and adventurous. 
 It may be Poison Ivy 
, that sort of thing, 
 so what are we going to do. 
 How would you convince  people?
 We kind of touched on this 
 but a good test question  would be \'96
 you've got a long elevator  ride
 to convince your CIO 
 that AI should be used 
 to improve the purchasing. 
 process. 
 I know at IBM, 
 we often say that the  purchasing department
 is there to prevent you from  buying anything.
 Because it can be very 
 onerous finding out 
 who the approved supplier is 
. 
 Software is particular  dangerous
. 
 So how would you do that? 
 How would you prepare for  that discussion?
 When you are trying to say 
 alright, what do I do to  commence this person
 and she is very smart 
 and she knows all of this  stuff,
 how do I make the case? 
 Where a cognitive 
 system really could make a  difference.
 Thoughts? 
 It is quiet today. 
 (Laughs) 
 While that is why we are  here, right, we are trying to 
learn this. 
 
 I think one way you could  think about it
 is 
 it is not always accuracy  and efficiency we are after,
. 
 A lot of the times it is  nearly as accurate as a human
 or needs of small  improvements that might not 
be enough to convince  someone. But I think a lot of 
the time these solutions are  valuable because they bring a 
lot more accessibility or  scalability, or ease-of-use. 
There is a lot more access  being able to apply maybe a 
set of skills that previously  were very scarce to experts.
 To a broader scale 
 is aware a lot of the value  lies for these systems.
 Absolutely. 
 In fact, one of the  questions on the quiz
 is suppose you have a set  series of questions.
 Maybe you are a first-line  insurance helpdesk person.
 There is a series of  questions you're going to ask.
 The Assistant can make sure  that you get those questions 
answered or the person hangs  up in frustration.
 But you have a script, 
 you have to get the answers 
 so you know what to do with  the call.
 Toyota and (unknown term),  you call their phone number
 and you get the message 
 phone tree. 
 It's the same thing 
 except we are the AI. 
 We are helping it to 
 decide where to go 
 by actually selecting where  to go.
 If you do not know, 
 then you have to wait for AI  on the other end.
 Interesting. 
 Let's have a look at the  books idea
 of how to go about  decomposing the stuff.
 We have AI canvas, we call  it.
 And I found it to be very  helpful.
 I have use it at IBM, 
 I have used it for a couple  of independent products that 
I had. 
 You already booked so I  don't have to read it to you
 but it is an organized way  to go about deciding
 what exact way are you doing. 
 I can't tell you how many  times,
 whether it is security 
, programming, AI, 
 where someone says something  like
 let's just put a little AI  over it to make it more 
secure, I actually had to say  that this morning. Anyway,
 you need to organize the  thinking.
 Because everybody and their  brother thinks AI is cool and 
it will make us look smart,  but what are you really 
trying to do?  And that is the first 
question on canvas is what  are you examining?
 What task are you trying to  figure out?
 And then all of the other  steps as you go through it
 help you refine that idea  and help you figure out
 OK, 
 I am really trying to predict 
 which office I need to send  this call over to.
 It sounds trivial but it is  not.
 To do it right and to do it  well.
 You are trying to decide 
 which (Indiscernible), 
 maybe that needs to be  broken down even more.
 That is why when we talk  with the project next week,
 the one thing I will say  over and over is you are not 
going to do 'Jeopardy!' and  the time we have left.
 You need to focus 
 and you need to pick  specific problems that are 
actually doable in the  timeframe you have, with the 
team that you have.  So going through this canvas
... 
 What about the judgement? 
 Judgement has always been  kind of a fuzzy thing in the 
book.  Do any of you have any ideas 
about what judgement really  means?
 We have the cognitive system  making suggestions,
 but what is this judgement  thing, in your words?
 Don't read from the text.  Give me an example.
 Come on, come on point 
. 
 We know what the AI does,  the cognitive system makes a 
recommendation, except  addiction.
. 
 
 I guess just using  real-world experience that 
the AI doesn't have, 
 stuff that is more general  than the data it is presented.
 The example in the book was  treatment options for patients
 but the fact that the doctor  can actually talk to a 
patient and understand their  mental state, that may be 
hard to put into data that  you can feed it to AI but it 
is valuable information.  Right now only humans can 
 Very good.
 It would be particularly  difficult to attract from the 

 One would be 
 radiology for example, 
 where (Indiscernible) but  the human can go judge what 
is correct.  It is a very high-stakes 
situation.  Kind of in a different vein,
 talking about how automation 
 brings that judgement into  AI itself
 for example like a self  driving car.
 The car will itself  determine the path
, 
 and actually act on  requiring human judgement 

 People have used the term  payoff
 but it is really just the  goal.
 Didn't work and that sort of  thing.
 The judgement question thing 
 is usually what gives the  approving managers pause.
 Because they are wondering 
 - 
 we are not going to just  handle
 over control 
 so how are we going to judge  whether or not we want to do 
 I don't have an 
 but when I think about  judgement,
 I also think about 
 foresight. 
 And kind of consequences. 
 of making a certain decision 
 and it kind of ties back into 
 the guest lecture we had on  AI ethics.
 Kind of 
 thinking through the impact 
 of the decision or the  prediction.
 
 As you said, 
 the ethics and the culture 
 and even the way people feel  about this
, 
 even down to things like 
 the culture of being in a 
 line at the bank, 
 in some cultures it is not  uncommon for the person 
behind you to be right up  against you looking over your 
shoulder.  In others,
 that is just not OK, we  don't do that.
 So is it moral 
, 
 it gets down to really  squishy stuff sometimes.
 
 I was going to bring up from  the book
 the example of the chess AI. 
 Where it looked at the Grand  Master plays
 and it found that  sacrificing the Queen
 came right before the  victories usually, so it 
would sacrifice the Queen  early on. But the main 
defining feature of judgement  is reason and he that is 
human reason.  So having the outside 
knowledge that overrides 
, obviously you don't want to  sacrifice the Queen early on,
 is what is essential to  making the decision on the 

 What is the real judgement  there?
 That's a great example from  the book.
 We have prediction 
 \'96 
 what is the key thing you're  trying to figure out and 
predict?  Is there a car in front of 
the truck that is in front of  me?
 Or more generally, because  you don't want to be too 
 if you go to specific then  you end up with too many efts.
 if.s. 
 We talked about the  judgement, the actions are 
sort of obvious.  What are you recommending 
that I do and the outcome is  what we just said \'96
 how do you know if it was  any good? How do you measure? 
The Tesla might say that it  did not hit anything, OK,
 perhaps that is a nice  overall goal.
 But there might be many other 
, finer measures that you  will apply.
 Training. 
 When you make your proposal, 
 you have to think about how  you're going to teach this
?.  How are you going to show the 
cognitive system 
 examples of what a human  would do,
 if that is what you're  trying to do?
 You may be trying to build AI 
 that simulates a great white  shark. OK,
 sharks do what sharks do. 
 But of course you don't  understand,
 you cannot put yourself in  the head of the shark
 so it is not clear that we  are going to get a very good 
model of that.  But people are trying.
 What do you use to make a  decision?
 What input? 
 This goes back to again,  from the book,
 the baseball decision. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 You are deciding based on  the attractiveness of the 
partner of a player?  Come on.
 Maybe that played out  correctly in one or two cases
 but it became part of the  general process.
 And once you find out what  the rule of thumb is that 
people are using, when you  finally nagged the expert 
until she tells you 
 why certain decisions are  made
, 
 you have no idea. 
 You may not have any idea 
 that grandma cut off the end  of the pot roast
. 
 And then feedback, 
 you have to determine 
 how you're going to measure  the outcome and then decide
 if it works, how well did it  work?
 Tesla didn't crash. 
 Good. 
 Could you tell me more? 
 Could you use any other  additional information
 to try to enlighten that? 
 And then one of the problems 
 that we cannot avoid 
 \'96 jobs. 
 What is it going to do 
 to the overall workflow 
 into which we are embedding  this cognitive system?
 And of course the authors of  our text
 spent a lot of time talking  about job impact and so on.
 A friend of mine came up  with a system
, and this is back in the 80s, 
 but digitize a person. 
 It was a short female, 
 because the digitizer was  not very big,
 she put on a leotard 
 and digitized it. 
 Two or three passes 
 and he built the model. 
 And when he had generated his 
 breakthrough, 
 he had patterns for clothing  manufacturers
 in various sizes. 
 They did it. 
 One of the other guys on the  team
 I think was very good with a  sewing machine, so he sewed 
it.  Put it on her
 and it kind of fit. 
 It's not clear that she  would have worn it anywhere 
outside of the lab 
 because certain things were  right and certain things were 
just awful.  So he worked on it and got 
better and better.  The reason I am telling you 
this is because when he went  to talk to the clothing 
manufacturer organization,  they said thank you very much 
but they are not interested.  Because if they get into a 
fight with local government  or whoever,
 they can just pick up their  sewing machine then leave.
 If they had a bunch of  computers and digitizers,
 where do you find 
 15 standard people 
 They saw other problems with  it
 so it was a cool technology  and it worked
, mostly, 
 but there were externalities. 
 that really messed it up. 
 That prevented it from  taking over
 and being a pervasive, cool  technology.
 So these externalities that  the book talks about
, these are huge. 
 What is it going to do to  the people around it?
 Think of the previous, 
 we have all been in one 
 and you probably weren't  aware at first because you 
cannot hear the thing. 
 Seeing-eye dogs were stumped  for a long time.
 That was an impact that I'm  not sure people thought about.
 What is the impact 
 on hearing-impaired people 
, 
 or rather blind people, 
 they do not know what is  coming so
 they cannot necessarily hear  it, whether they have hearing 
or not.  How do you fix this problem?
 AI 
 working on another one that  I'm familiar with,
 -- 
 this is not at IBM 
 but there is one trying to  optimize
 supplier selection. 
 Or manufacturing. 
 Trying to figure out 
 whose products have been the  best,
 get here on time, there are  a bunch of parameters and 
there is a cognitive system  involved.
 The AI very quickly start in  choosing the same supplier 
over and over again.  That is maybe the right thing 
to do, as far as all of those  measurements go. But what 
happens if that one supplier  goes out of business
 or has a chip shortage? 
 Again, the impact on the  workflow
 is a disaster if the AI  naturally migrates
 towards an optimization 
 that does not have all of  the facts, like Tracy said.
 What is it going to do two  jobs?
 Is the past CEO of IBM right 
 in declaring that we are not  going to have
 -- 
 we are not concerned about  job displacement,
 we are instead focusing on 
 new collar jobs. 
 Implying retraining and so  on.
 I am not sure how well that  is going to work.
 but we will see. 
 Another item mentioned 
 somewhere in the reading 
 is 
 if you look at statistics, 
 one of the top jobs 
 is truck driving. 
 Trucks, who knew? 
 I didn't. 
 There are a lot of trucks  out there,
 not just the long-haul  things but
 the trucks in town delivering 
 two houses 
. 
 There is no reason why those  can be automated, right?
 Autonomous trucks? 
 Would make a lot more sense  than autonomous cars.
 Much more constrained, 
. 
 Like I was exciting to my  son who wants to get a 
drivers license, driving a  dirt bike is one thing
 because of the constraints,  everyone goes in the same 
direction.  There is no oncoming traffic,
 speed is important 
 because you can't goad 
 to faster your heart  yourself.
 Real traffic is not like  that.
 So the impact on the  trucking industry
 is going to be very  interesting.
 I don't know how many of you  saw the AI boat
.  Fascinating.
 What is it going to do for  overseas travel?
 What the 
 Alaskan oil spill had  happened?
 If we had an autonomous ship. 
 Probably not the way that I  did happen
. 
 
 I would say yes 
 and that is because 
 from what I heard 
 from (unknown term), it was  mostly about weather.
 Which you cannot 
 always of -- 
 even if you can protect that  there is bad weather,
 there isn't all that much  that you can do sometimes.
 I think there is also other  economic decisions
 that put you into the wrong  path.
 If for example you decide to  put on
 twice as much cargo as you  should,
 AI would probably save you  after that.
 So there are all kinds of  upstream decisions
 that will probably still not  be able to be avoided
 by AI. 
 I definitely agree with the  trucking industry example
 but generally, 
 I think that transportation  in the US
 is 13% of the economy 
. 
 So if we replace all of the  truckers
 and all of the uber drivers, 
 it is going to be like 40 or  50 million people out of work.
 
 Or desperately trying to  learn something new.
 I don't know what the  average age
 of a truck driver or Uber  driver is
 but it is probably not 22. 
 OK, 
 just checking my notes. 
 Let's wander off into some  breakouts.
 I have it on the slides what  you can look at them later,
 they are not particularly  helpful.
 That sort of thing, again, 
 this is from the book and we  are going to go through an 
example. 
 I am going to do seven  groups this time because 
there are not many of us. 
 Here are the topics. 
 Again, 
 you got your book 
 and you can see the 
 little pattern thing that we  were just looking at.
 AI canvas. 
 I will put that up after we  start.
 Group 1, 
 talk about AI to help you  out with your
 (unknown term) members of  Congress.
 Choosing members of Congress 
 would be effective 
 for a particular situation. 
 High-performance job  candidates.
 We talked in the book about  high-performance MBA 
candidates but once you have  hired the person,
 how do you decide 
 or guess 
 how the potentials are? 
 My favourite \'96 
 the triage bought. 
 How do you prioritize  incoming patients?
 Ski way guest management. 
 An predicting cable TV  viewers,
 how would you sample them? 
 So let's see if we can  imagine
 working on 
 a cognitive system 
 to do these kinds of things. 
 And the question really is \'96 
 how do you fill in these  different areas,
 what are you trying to  predict,
