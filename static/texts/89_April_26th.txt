 OK, 
 we are delighted to have 
 a guest speaker 
 that I have had every time 
 I have taught this course. 
 Armin (Name) 
, I never say his name right, 
 I just mumbled. 
 He taught me everything  I know
 and more. 
 That I have forgotten. 
 He is a (unknown  term) developer
 at 
 (Name) University 
 and as such, 
 he learns all of  the cool stuff
 and then he gets to go  around and teach people about 
it and show them how it  can change their jobs,
 their education, 
 all kinds of interesting  applications.
 Data science, cognitive  security,
 blockchain AI, 
 the guy has many  plates in the air.
 He has been with IBM 
 or I don't know, 
 
 Going on 20, sir. 
 
 I can't do the math. 
 ToastMaster, 
 the guy has everything  going on here.
 He hangs out down  in Massachusetts
 and works on 
 Watson in an enclave, 
 he is also an adjunct Prof  at (unknown term) Tech in 
So today he is going to talk  to us about a new thing
 in the Watson family called  auto AI and I don't need to 
say anything else.  
Sharing is on, and Armen,  it's all yours. 
  Dr Palmer, thank you.
 I am so happy 
 I am seeing actual videos on, 
 I can't tell you how much 
 that means, thank you. 
 (Laughs) 
 Let me tell you I how I am  thinking of going about this \'96
 we are going to fly in an  airplane, I'm going to need a 
cocaptain.  
That means that one of you  will be sharing their screen
 and to gather, we  will build a model
, deploy that model, 
 and is zero (unknown term), 
 I think that is so cool  about some of these tools.
 Democratizing AI  and data science.
 So everyone 
 can be an AI engineer 
 or a data scientist. 
 (Name), great to see you. 
 I take it that all  of you, if not most,
 humming in the background. 
 Thumbs up on the screen  says yes you do,
 awesome. 
 (Name), 
 nice to see you. 
 Is it up to me to pick  someone to share their screen?
 I will start off candidly, 
 you share your screen and we  will do some magic together.
 The rest of you, 
 follow along if  you would like.
 If not, 
 you can watch and that  is pretty cool too.
 
 Who wants to be the  trusty sidekick today?
 
 I need a cocaptain. 
 It is a very new API. 
 
 We need someone who is able  to connect to IBM cloud
 to share their scream,  anybody want to learn 
firsthand? 
 Come on, 
 we need a victim. 
 Sorry \'96 participant. 
 I am going to pick one. 
 Who looks like they might  enjoy a good talk?
 That's the problem, there  are so many fun people out 
(Name), do you want to  be the co-teacher today?
 
 I can do it. 
 
 Alright! 
 You are on campus so you  probably have pretty good 
conductivity, right?  
 I am not on campus. 
 It's been fine so far. 
 
 Go for it, we have a winner. 
 Thank you.  
 
 Dear (Name), 
 share your screen  if you will.
 By the way, Charles, 
 I sent out a (unknown term) 
 via email and slack. 
 Awesome, I like this. 
 Nice. 
 This is great. 
 Let me see the five  services that you have
 humming there in. 
 There they are. 
 Not those three, the... 
 That's fine. 
 Never the wrong thing. 
 Let's see, 
 you have speech to text, 
 we are going to create 
 the new one. 
 This one actually is the  Bugatti (unknown term)
, of all of the services. 
 We are going to  get Watson studio.
 Click create resource,  please.
 And search for Watson studio. 
 There it is. 
 Everything is good 
 and let's click create. 
 If you see blue,  click at (Laughs)
 Big Blue. 
 Just put in something 
 so you can click continue. 
 Another continue. 
 I think another blue box  is going to show up,
 another blue box. 
 How to click more, 
 I think that is what they  are doing around here in that 
They like to make  us click more,
 while the whole board  is going to click less.
 Exit out, yes. 
 OK, welcome. 
 So think of Watson studio 
 as the very table that  you are sitting at.
 All these other services, 
 your phone, the keyboard, 
 whatever you may have, 
 can be housed by  Watson studio.
 Think of it as an IDE, 
 development and garment 
, 
 -- 
 development environment. 
 You can do more in here,  you can deploy or share,
 you can add emails  of your cohorts.
 To book them on  the same project.
 So the very first thing we  want to do is to create a new 
project, there is a bunch  of places you can do that. 
That's perfect.  
Empty project. 
 It is trying to find  your database,
 your cloud 
 database. 
 Give it a name, 
 we will wait for that  to do it's thinking.
 Now add, 
 create. 
 Refresh. 
 And we are ready. 
 Let's click create. 
 Now, let's go to  the assets tab.
 Now my dears, 
 as a data scientist, 
 as an AI engineer, 
 you are going to have a lot  of these different bars.
 Data assets, machine  learning, in fact,
 if you click on  add to project,
 another blue button up there, 
 notice 
 that these are all of the  different cool things
 that we can add  as we go along.
 Today we are featuring 
 auto AI experiment. 
 Give it some sort of a name. 
 And click 
 associate a machine learning 
 service. 
 We need a new 
 one, new service. 
 Type in machine learning, 
 I see it right  there, actually.
 It is in Dallas, 
 Dallas is good, 
 create. 
 So we hooked it  to a database,
 you need a database because  I'm going to give you a CSV 
file. 
 Get rid of that to  location things.
 And now 
, associate service. 
 
 The CSV tile is  in the general tab
 of our workspace. 
 General channel. 
 
 Let's take a look  at that CSV file.
 There it is, 
 I will go to Excel. 
 Let's take a look at this, 
 let's get familiar with  this before we read.
 So my dears, 
 this is from 
 (unknown term) competitions. 
 This data set was created 
 in the 1980s 
 in Germany. 
 They use a lot for  various activities
 and if I get an opportunity  to come back later on,
 we use the model  that we created
 out of AI to see how fair 
 As if the data 
 or is it the algorithm 
 that is causing bias? 
 So, 
 this is about people  in Germany
 who applied for a loan. 
 That is how much they had  in their checking account,
 the first guy had  somewhere from zero
 to $200. 
 The duration was 31 months,  credit history is a something,
 make the columns a little  bit wider, (Name).
 Credit history, loan purpose, 
 there was the amount, do  they have a savings account,
 how long they have  been employed,
 male or female, and so forth. 
 Now, 
 if we go way over  to the right,
 notice column U. 
 That is supervised training. 
 That is (unknown term). 
 So when you get this CSV  file out of your database,
 it doesn't have column U,  it has all of the others.
 So what happens over  time since 1982,
 somebody went in  after the fact
 to say that the first  guy was no risk
 so he could pay  his loan back.
 The fifth person, 
 was at risk of paying  their loan back.
 So now, 
 in 2021, 
 people are applying for loans 
 and we have a model. 
 Based on this model, 
 the folks at the bank 
 or the credit unit 
 can get a fair sense of 
 given these features 
, who might be at risk of  paying their loan back
 and who might not. 
 In another activity, 
 we could do that  on another time
 when we use open scale. 
 Open scale comes back  and looks at this
, after we build  our model here \'96
 first we have to  build the model.
 COVID has happened,  things have changed.
 Right now, 
 females are in a better  position to pay their loans
 than males. 
 So this (unknown term) here  might not be all that good.
 Just because a person  is 18 to 25 years old
 and has (unknown term)  in their bank account,
 this model says  to reject them.
 Unbeknownst to us, their  parents are millionaires.
 So we have to take  this into account
, as our model starts  to drift and wither.
 But first we have  to build the model.
 So this is 5000 rows long 
, 
 we are going to do 
 an auto AI, 
 we are going to  tell her to take
 45% of this and use it  as your training set.
 Go ahead and look at the  entrance, build patterns.
 Don't look at column U, 
 say wow you would predict 
 based on the other 4500 Rose 
 that you are learning. 
 Much like how we  learn for an exam.
 Good enough, 
 let's go back to  our Watson studio.
 Close that out. 
 You can click associate  service,
 clearly it has  been associated,
 we hope and trust. 
 Let's go to what is known  as the hamburger icon
 or, in the black bar,  you will see the icon.
 And let's go to projects. 
 Let's go into that project. 
 Nice, auto AI, 
 other experiment. 
 Yes, let's like that, 
 give it a name, 
 the same one 
 because this time it knows  and has a machine learning 
Nice. 
 I shouldn't say  nice to quickly
 because 
, 
! 
 I think I can say nice now. 
 Alright, 
 brows and go to your desktop 
 and grab that file. 
 This is going  to be very cool.
 By the way Dr Palmer, 
 how much time do I have? 
 
 We officially finish at 
 1250, 
 50. 
 
 Good enough. 
 That's new \'96 
 create a timeseries forecast. 
 Oh man, 
 I go downstairs  and then I come up
 to my home office and  they have change the UI.
 No, this is not going  to be a timeseries.
 Now let's go to risk. 
 Let's pause for a moment. 
 Notice 
 in the risk column, 
 you have risk or no risk. 
 Risk, even though  it is a string,
 the system knows  it is binary.
 One or zero, yes or no. 
 From the drop-down, 
 let's go pick 
 instead of risk, 
 just for the fun of it, 
 let's pick... 
 Loan amount. 
 Notice it is a regression. 
 Do you see that,  how a change?
 It look at the  column and said
 (unknown term), 
 so you can divide 
 and let's pick one 
 for me 
 that is a  multi-classification.
 You kind of have to remember  the spreadsheet.
 Like one, two, three, four 
... 
 Multiclass! 
 How cool is that? 
 If it wasn't for auto AI, 
 and we were doing  this in Python,
 you would have to press 
 the space after the  dot in your code
 and scroll to find 
 and no, 
 which prediction tab  you need to use.
 This tool does  the job for you.
 So we appreciate that. 
 Alright, back to risk. 
 Before we click  the blue button,
 let's click the  black button \'96
 experiment settings. 
 90% 
 training 
, 
 10% test. 
 We can move that around 
 but we will keep  it like that.
 It says all columns, 
 this is a cool place 
 for you to maybe uncheck 
, 
 if this comes out  of a database
 you will also see Social  Security number, telephone 
number, email, 
 we do not need those. 
 If this was Europe, 
 GDP art, California  has a good one too.
 This gives us an 
 opportunity to say that this  column is not a predictable 
column, Social Security  number \'96
 I don't need that. 
 Birthday might be interesting 
 but then you have  the age column.
 In this case, everything is  cool, we need everything.
 Go back to the table  of contents there,
 and let's ask for  the predictions.
 Binary classification,  let's scroll down.
 You see those things \'96 
 ROC (Reads), 
 After we are done  with the slide,
 I want to spend a few  minutes talking about those 
things.  
I think as a data scientist, 
 one of the big things 
 that we are 
 is the relationship between 
 two universes,  they are related.
 The universe that talks  about accuracy, precision,
 and the universe  that talks about
 false-negative, 
 these two are connected. 
 I want to make that  connection how?
 What formula gets  me from accuracy
 to true positive 
 measure. 
 Let's scroll down. 
 We have a brand-new item, 
 gradient boost classifier, 
 let's select that. 
 Gradient boost classifier 
 is really 
, really (unknown term). 
 It is a random classifier 
, same as the one up there 
, except it gives it 
 a gradient dissent  algorithm to it,
 much like a (unknown  term) neural network.
 You have a branch that  is saying yes, yes,
 you can't even break that. 
 Yes or no, you  can break that.
 The gradient boosting  classifier says
 I am not done with that, 
 because everything  is yes in that branch
 and it doesn't  break up anymore,
 I am going to beat on  it a little bit more
 and use weights. 
 That's what the gradient  does, it uses weights
 to find out what  is the salience.
 If I decrease it a little  bit, the importance,
 or add a bit more, 
 the weight goes 
 like the synapse of  a neural network.
 You are noticing 
 there is one part, 
 one, two, three, four, 
 we can (unknown term) 
 but I want to show your  way to save money.
 To save credit unit hours. 
 Because if you run out  of credit unit hours,
 you cannot move forward. 
 You have to wait until  the month changes
 and then every thing  goes back to zero.
 Or you can work  on a new email
 with your new cloud  certification, and so on.
 Not to worry. 
 Just about with the 20  credit hours given to machine 
learning, that is the one  that really eats up a lot
 because it is a feature, 
 you won't really hit  that in a months time.
 You would have to do  this like nine times,
 so you are cool. 
 We will select two, 
 let me look at the time  on the predictions
 in the table of contents. 
 Right under predictions, 
 it says 
 (unknown term). 
 The left panel, 
 go to there. 
 
 Sorry, I'm a little lost  on where we are going.
 
 We are exploring data  source prediction
 run time. 
 We export the data source, 
 we ask for prediction, 
 now it is time for runtime. 
 I just wanted to show you 
 feature engineering, 
. 
 Feature engineering is  a fancy way of saying
 when I take those two  columns in the spreadsheet
, add or multiply or  make a new column,
 or the sign tangent  are cosigned,
 so that is what future  engineering means.
 Take two columns, 
 do something with the  two or three columns,
 create a new column 
 and that will be my  other (unknown term).
 Not just risk or no risk, 
 so the machine  does that for us.
 Just to make sure 
 that our model 
 is as good as it can be. 
 It doesn't just 
 confine itself to 19  columns, so that is all it 
 There is nothing wrong with  having 29 columns, the 
machine creates them. 
 If someone says to you  feature engineering,
 that is a fancy way of  saying to add a new column by 
adding or subtracting 
 numbers in existing columns. 
 Now, save settings. 
 Now we are ready. 
 Run excitement. 
 This will take a few minutes. 
 
 While we are waiting, 
 would you say that the  great appeal of auto AI
 is that you basically  throw data added
 and it digs around  and tries to find
 ways to derive the  target column?
 I mean it's just combining  those columns,
 hooking around, 
 we have no idea 
 which any number of columns 
 leads to the best prediction. 
 
 The particular thing  that you said
 is a subset 
 of the thing it  is trying to do.
 It's like a little  task or feat.
 The big job of this 
 is creating a model. 
 Doing that feature  engineering
 is a janitorial work 
 that we usually don't even 
 -- 
 we leave it to be in  the background sort of.
 By the way, (Name), 
 click on swap of view. 
 See where the branch 
 is like two branches going  up in the right panel,
 swap view is above it. 
 These are the (unknown term). 
 Remember how we selected  number two,
 there was number one to four, 
 that is the two. 
 It goes upstairs, 
 and then another (unknown  term) goes downstairs.
 If we had three, there  would be 1/3 branch.
 For, there would  be 1/4 branch.
 Right now, 
 it is going through  its mathematics.
 It did the split from the  beginning, it read the data 
set, 90%, 10%, 
 preprocessing. 
 Preprocessing is cool \'96 
 it says hey, that  is a string,
 that is a Boolean. 
, 
 that is intruders. 
 -- Integers. 
 I'm going to start a model 
 with gradient  boost classifier
 and right off the bat, 
 (unknown term) one  becomes a winner. 
It is .8.  
Not good enough. 
 Maybe try to do some hyper  parameter optimization.
 Hyper parameter optimization  is a fancy way of saying
 adding weight to the various 
 slots, 
 finding out the saliency 
 of which one is -- 
 is it age, is it  checking account,
 is that loan duration? 
 One of these 
 has a big impact 
 on whether I should give  this person alone or not.
 And it does feature  engineering,
 which feature engineering,  we will talk a little bit 
more.  
It is creating  the other column
 so it is very much of  a minute, in her detail.
 P2 is not a winner, let's  give P3 a chance.
 We are just going to have to  wait until it does its math.
 P3 has done better! 
 That hyper feature  engineering,
 let's give it one  more chance to see
 how P4 does. 
 What I'm going to do 
 is we want weight 
 for this whole thing 
, in the downstairs part  to get filled up.
 We have work to do. 
 If P4 becomes a winner, 
 we take it. 
 If not, 
 at the top you see a circle 
 with a square in it, 
 we will stop the experiment. 
 if you for a few minutes. 
 P4 didn't make  it, good enough.
 Let's stop the experiment. 
 This is how you  can save money.
 or credit unit hours. 
 I will show you where you  can keep an eye on that.
 So we will wait, 
 scroll down. 
 Pipeline generator  was stopped.
 Click on the winning  pipeline.
 Accuracy 
 .784, 
 is that the winning  pipeline Qu\'e9bec
 yes, I think it is. 
 Go in there again. 
 The cross validation is 802,  so this is the right one.
 Now, do you see that curve? 
 If that curve 
 was close to the  diagonal line,
 that would be a 50-50 gas. 
 We don't need auto AI, 
 to give me a 50-50 gas. 
 Now the blueline babbles up 
 and hugs the very top, 
 and hugs the very x-axis, 
 almost. 
 That is what makes  it closer to
 99.9%. 
 Never 100%. 
 If you got 100%, 
 accuracy 1.0, 
 there was something wrong  in one of the columns.
 You have to go  remove a column
 that is missing our data up. 
 This looks OK, 
 we will come back and  address these receivable 
operating curve, 
 ROC (unknown term). 
 Now, you are in  model evaluation.
 Let's take a look at  the confusion matrix.
 (Name), 
 can you bring up a  calculator right here
 back? 
 From your machine. 
 Nice, let's add 92+75 
+33 
+299 
 - 
 how many rows were  in the spread sheet?
 5000. 
 What is 90% of 5000? 
 4500, 
. 
 So this is done 
 on the 10%. 
 So the machine said 
, the computer looks  at the auto AI
 and it says 
 \'96 no risk. 
 It says 
 that out of those 500 rows, 
 92 of them 
 are said 
 that they are no risk 
 and when I looked  at the answer,
 I was right. 
 I missed that on the 75. 
 I said that the  75 were no risk
 but when I looked at  the (unknown term),
 they were risky.  
And they have COVID 
 but then you actually 
 didn't, the test was wrong. 
 The risk, the other one says 
 all of those 500 rose 
s 
 - 
 I got almost 
 399 of them right.  
I was trained on 4500 
 and without looking  at the answer,
 I predicted that 300 of  them were indeed risky
 and it looks like they were. 
 I got 33 of them wrong. 
 It is very key to know this. 
 This is tough, 
 this is like saying  33 of them
 -- 
 for example, if you did not  have COVID but you actually 
did.  
What's the next one? 
 Precision recall curve. 
 Next one, model information. 
 Now these are the  number of features,
 23 features, 
 that it wrestled with 
 in the columns 
 and the rows were 499 rows. 
 It used the gradient  boost classifier.
 OK, thank you. 
 What is the other one \'96 
 feature transformations? 
 Some loan durations so, 
 that's what it did \'96 
 it took the loan duration  and the age and it made a 
summary. 
 The other went to the loan  duration, the loan amount, 
so...  
This is how it is building  those extra columns
 that it thinks 
 might shed a better light 
 over which one  of those columns
, was at age or loan duration, 
 was it many other  people on the loan,
 what is it that  made me decide
 it is a risk or a no risk. 
 So little bit of  help over there.
 What about feature  importance?
 One of those new features 
 had importance 
 but if we go up, 
 to current residence, 
 owns property, 
 others are on loan, 
 these are predictions of 
 how it might be risky. 
 If you have been in your  apartment for two months,
 the machine says that you  are going to default on this 
loan. 
 If you don't own property  and are renting,
 the machine says 
 that if the guy owns pho- 
-- five houses, 
 he is fine. 
 Come to know that the guy  who owns five houses and have 
a Lamborghini is so in debt.  
(Laughs) Others on the loan, 
 when you have other  people on alone,
 the odds of not  paying it back
 kind of goes up. 
 And it decreases 
 as the importance falters. 
 You see where it says 
 save as? 
 Let's do this. 
 We are going to do  this in two ways.
 You can save it as a model, 
 you can save it  as a notebook.
 Let me look at the  time to see...
 We are going to save  it as a model.
 Let's go to model 
 and create, 
 so this gets a  little bit clicky
 in here, 
 we have to click a  lot but stay with me.
 To deploy this model 
 for the future generations, 
 first we have to 
 create a space. 
 A container. 
 Viewing project, nice! 
 That's what I mean by spice. 
 Promote to space, sure. 
 New space, 
 it a name. 
 Any name. 
 good enough, 
 create. 
 We create a deployment 
 because in that space, 
 you can have a bunch  of different models.
 It is like a big bucket, 
 you can then pick your models 
 from the big bucket. 
 When this comes to fruition, 
 I want to take a moment  to talk about
 the confusion metrics 
 and its relationship with 
 true positive and  false positive
, etc. 
 
 What is a deployment  space connect
 
 It is merely a container. 
 Now you can click 
 premier. 
 -- Promote. 
 Otherwise, you have to but  each of your models in a 
different room. 
 If I had a big room, I could  put a whole lot of furniture 
in there.  
You do not need eight rooms  because you have eight 
chairs, you can put all of  your eight chairs in one room.
 (Multiple speakers) 
 
 Scroll down a little, 
 let me see what  else there is.
 Let's go in that estimator. 
 Go to activities. 
 No, no, close that out. 
 Go to the hamburger icon 
 in the black bar. 
 Let's look at space,  do you see deployments?
 There are probably  not any deployments.
 View all spaces. 
 Go back to overview, 
 something is good? 
 Finish run. 
 That's good \'96 
 let's go there. 
 Let's look at deployments. 
 Back to space. 
 Maybe essays wasn't created. 
 Don't use the back arrow, 
 in the browser, 
 use that. 
 View all spaces,  let's do that.
 That's funny, 
 when you hover over that \'96 
 not the link, but hover  over the white space.
 I am trying to find a  picture of a spaceship
 that looks like a deployment. 
 What is that three dots? 
 OK, 
 active demo space. 
 -- 
 Back to demo space. 
 Assets. 
 In the breadcrumbs 
, 
 see in the top it says  deployment/demo space,
 let's go to deployments. 
 That is how we go back. 
 Let's delete this. 
 Click on the three dots 
 there, 
 we will make a new one. 
 Very successful in deleting. 
 Different name. 
 Nice. 
 
 I still think Watson should  play the 'Jeopardy!' song
 when it is thinking. 
 
 Remember they were watching  this earlier,
 the box was going woozy? 
 I don't know if  that is anything,
 right now it is  actually stable.
 
 It was nervous before. 
 
 Yeah (Laughs) 
 I wonder, 
 I wonder my dears, 
 should we have selected 
 a storage service down there? 
 We will see. 
 
 I think we definitely need  to have a part to hear.
 I will work with  you after class.
  Do a new space.
 Go back to deployments 
 in the breadcrumbs. 
 If you hover over it, 
 what happens if we do 
 new deployments space again? 
 The blue box. 
 Give it another crazy name. 
 Select storage service, 
 you have got it, 
 select machine learning. 
 Maybe that is what  we are missing,
 so you have (Reads). 
 Storage is selected, OK, 
 there might be hope for us. 
 Go to create now. 
 We did not have the machine  learning selected,
 so I have semi-high hopes. 
 OK, close that. 
 Give it a different name. 
 
 c 
. 
 Everything is set, let's  do create again.
 I doubt that was the issue. 
 Let's go back to deployments. 
 OK, 
 if you hover over  those lines,
 that is weird, 
 I am not seeing the picture 
 of the rocketship 
 that usually appears  right there.
 Go to the third  times a charm.
 Let's do this \'96 
 hamburger icon, 
 new demo project, 
 scroll down, 
 open up that model 
 way in the bottom. 
 Come on, 
 we did everything just right. 
 OK, 
 one more try. 
 Go back to the  hamburger icon,
 go to projects, 
 new demo project, 
 and let's call down. 
 This time, click the  auto AI experiment.
 Yes. 
 Select the winning pipeline, 
 right there, 
 where it says save as. 
 Click save as, 
 let's do notebook. 
 If you see the pop up appear 
 in the top right corner, 
 OK, 
 viewing project. 
 One could considerably  deploy and notebook,
 click the pencil icon. 
, 
 so it is activated. 
 You can set this as  a (unknown term) file,
 there is a save as up there, 
 and pass it to friends. 
 And they can then use it 
 as their model 
 to deploy against. 
 Take a look later on 
 to see what was up 
 with that auto deployment. 
 Charles, 
 you are saying we have  three minutes left?
 
 Yes. 
 (Laughs) 
 
 Click not trusted, 
 because we need to make  this not trusted,
 remember to always do this. 
 So now 
 this is what happened  in auto AI
 while we were clicking away. 
 If we scroll down, 
 the Col refreshed, 
 a lot of good stuff 
. 
 What did it do? 
 It installed a data frame, 
 yeah. 
 X 
 it generated all 
 of this code for us. 
 
 You see somewhere it says  .01, you can change that in 
here.  
 
 If you are a Python person, 
 it might be easier 
 with this once you play  around with the numbers
, parameters I guess. 
 
 I will find out what it is  that was giving us an issue
 with the deployment  of the model.
 But I think I lost on the  opportunity of talking about
 true positive 
 or the confusion matrix 
, I had a very cool  story for you.
 I don't get is going to fit. 
 Let me try. 
 If people have to drop, 
 it will be in the recording,  so go ahead.
  Awesome, awesome.
 Let me bring up my sharing. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Where is the clap reactions? 
 (Laughs) 
 I am going to share  my screen here.
 I am going to tell  you about the story
... 
 Thank you zoom 
 for always helping out 
 work with my 
... 
 Alright, 
 I guess if you have to leave  in the middle of my story,
 then by all means go. 
 This is the confusion matrix. 
 Over here we have  true positive.
 Over here we have  false positive.
 Over here we have 
 false negative. 
 And true negative. 
 The story is as follows, 
 not too far from over here, 
 there is a place called 
 Blue Hills. 
 It is a decent hell, 
 it is evergreens, 
 and in the wintertime, 
 the trees look blue. 
 They make all of the organic  food on a farm there
 and in that farm,  there is a boy
 who was extreme Lee board. 
 He has been board for years. 
 One night 
 he opened up the window, 
 and when he looks out 
 he sees a wolf. 
 walking towards  the chicken hand.
 He opens the window at 3 AM, 
 screams out the window 
 at the wall. 
lf 
. 
 All of the villagers wake up 
 and they run outside  and shoot the wolf.
 Let's insert text. 
 In this case, 
 the wolf is positive 
 class. 
 And 
 no wolf is negative. 
 class. 
 That story that I told you, 
 where would it fit in this? 
 You're absolutely right, 
 that is a true positive. 
 So, both present. 
 Boy cries wolf. 
 The test showed COVID 
 and indeed, you had it. 
 That's fine. 
 The next day,  the boy wakes up
, 
 looks out the window 
 and there is no wolf. 
 He opens the window 
 and screams 
 out for the wolf, 
 so all of the villagers  wake up
 and run outside 
 and there is no wolf. 
 They are really  mad at the boy,
 he is in the doghouse,  or is it the wolf house? 
(Laughs) Where does  that go for? 
No wolf but he said  that there is.
 
 False positive. 
 
 Nicely done, 
 thank you Joseph. 
 No wolf, 
 boy cries well. 
 -- Wolf. 
 Another night, 
 he wakes up and  opens the window
, 
 there is actually no 
 wolf out there. 
 But still, he opens  up the window at 3 AM
 and he yells out that  there is no wolf,
 the villagers still wake up 
 and they are like  fine, go to sleep.
 Where does that go? 
 
 True negative. 
 
 Nice, nice, Tracy. 
 So no wolf, 
 cries no will. 
 Tell me what should  I put in here?
 I didn't catch that. 
 
 Cries wolf 
 but there is a wolf. 
 
 No wolf, 
 that would be the  one upstairs.
 False negative, right? 
 The wolf is coming, 
 it is threatening  the chicken house,
 opens the window 
 and says 
 that 
 the villagers through  the boy in the doghouse
 so let the wealth  eat the chicken.
 In the morning,  there is carnage.
 So wolf present, 
 he says nothing. 
 How is this connected 
 to 
 (unknown term) precision? 
 Back to my drawings in here. 
 So this is a dot board. 
 -- Dartboard. 
 and we are playing darts. 
 This is the first thing, 
 I go into the (unknown term), 
 I don't even remember  what that is like,
 I first thank 
 that I got this, 
 even though I am really  not a doctor here.
 Bam, bam, bam. 
 That, ladies and gentlemen, 
 is precise 
 but it is not accurate. 
 My buddy comes up and says  no, let me try this.
 This is where his  darts are landing.
 So that is accurate 
 and precise. 
 After a few beers 
 when the ugly lights come on, 
 bam, bam. 
 That's (unknown  term) (Laughs)
 The ugly lights come on. 
 So how do we connect  these, you may ask.
 I will use a different  colour maybe.
 So this is really the trick 
 behind, 
 if you want to find  out accuracy.
 Sometimes accuracy is not 
 such a big deal, 
 it is recalls that I want. 
 If on Netflix, I am trying  to find science-fiction movies
 and I do not know which one  is going to do it for me,
 I am not looking for  accurate or precise movies,
 just give me a list and  I will go pick one.
 Recall becomes really  important but if this is a 
cancer or a tomb or, 
 I need 99.8% accuracy  if it is benign or make
7F malignant. 
 Recalling here is not  going to do anything
 so accuracy becomes  important over there.
 This is a funky one. 
 The way you would do it  is to take to positive,
 +2 negative, 
 and divide by all of them. 
 All of them. 
 That is accuracy. 
 What is precision? 
 How do you cockily precision? 
 You take the true positive 
 and divide it by 
 true positive 
 plus false positive,  these two.
 And of course, 
 recall is the whole thing. 
 When we were looking at 
 receivable operating curve 
 that the machine was doing, 
 it was calculating  these metrics
 using the simple formula. 
 These two are benign. 
 I told you you had COVID 
 and you did have  COVID, got it.
 I told you you didn't have  COVID and you didn't have 
COVID, audit.  
But these are problematic. 
 This is not good. 
 But, the story behind  what auto AI does,
 the predictions that it makes 
 in the funky graph  that it shows,
 and how the world  of confusion matrix
 commits to the world 
 of accuracy recall 
 and precision. 
 
 Very cool. 
 This is a very subtle thing 
, differences between  the two things.
 I often get them confused. 
 Any questions or  comments on that?
 Alright, 
 we are a few minutes over. 
 (Name), did you  have a question?
 No, OK. 
 We are a little bit over. 
 We will go ahead  and close out now,
 tank you very much Mr Armen. 
 I will see about arranging 
 a second part to this 
, so we can go from the model 
 and go into the 
 open scale. 
 Go into open scale 
 and show the bias discussion 
 because that is where  we are headed next.
 Armen and I are both buddies  with our guest speaker on 
Wednesday, she is amazing.  
She is a force. 
 With that, 
 ask again everybody. 
 We will meet again  on Wednesday,
 I will be releasing the  study guide for Friday's quiz.
 Momentarily. 
 An arm and, once again, 
 despite Bluemix 
 and cloud 
 and everybody working  against us, you win.
 That's why all of our  assignments are submitted in 
video (Laughs) Anyway, thank  you very much folks.
