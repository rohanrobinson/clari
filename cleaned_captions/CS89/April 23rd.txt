 That's hers. 
 OK, 
 what did you think about  the reading today?
 Any comments or  thoughts there?
 Anything give you pause? 
 
 I mean, 
 sometimes the examples  missed the mark a little bit.
 I really liked the example 
 with the whole flying, 
 so if you have ever  missed a flight
 then you're not  being efficient.
 Which is a little unusual 
 because that also means  that you have never
 sat nine allowance between  connecting flights.
 The ones that you can't  control, right?
 There is also the fact that 
 I think a lot of the  things are predictable
 but there are many things  that are rather hard to 
 like (unknown term) is great  at predicting how you get 
there but then predicting  how many people are there,
 that would take knowing all  of the flights that come out 
of the airport.  
This has been a challenge  because you think at 4 AM 
they're not going to be  many people, but at 4 AM,
 all of the cheap flights  are flying within Europe. 
Which means 4 AM is probably  one of the busiest times of 
the day so it really does  depend on what day it is. 
I think a machine could  probably protect that pretty 
accurately but I think that  you know, it needs a little 
bit more work.  
 What you're using  there is additional 
information that the  machine didn't have. 
Traffic conditions or take  the boy skiing and then find 
out that there is an NCAA  downhill at that point
 and you have to park at  Hanover to get there. 
 I guess part of the reading 
 that was most interest  in to me
 was a discussion about the 
 legal and ethical parts of it 
 because I think to  a certain extent,
 a lot of the discussion  before is more technical
 whereas this is more  philosophical.
 Kind of coming at it  from the point of view
 of an economist 
 talking about externalities 
 and I guess I was a  little sceptical about
, 
 I guess that was  the only proposed
 solution in those cases 
 but I was a little sceptical 
 of the ability to like 
 quantify 
 or empirically assess 
 the value of different  actions.
 Especially in the context  that is used a lot
 like the teslas 
 for driving cars, 
 you have to distinguish  between choices that involve
 human life. 
 That was on the get  stuck out to me.
 Let's wreck 
 
 The only problem I have  with the entire book
 is that they trot out  the trolley problem
 and that is so beat  to death (Laughs)
 But it raises the same  point that you said there
 which is some of these  things are realistic
 and some of them aren't. 
 But they certainly help  make the point, I guess.
 It is hard to decide 
 what is more important,  this or that.
 And of course, that is what  we are going to do today
 but anyway.  
 
 I briefly talked with  us in the first class
 but when he talks about 
 fully automated  decision-making,
 I do feel like they  kind of forget
 that a lot of disc 
 -- decision-making 
 is based off of  machine input.
 For example, when they came  to the (unknown term)
 in 2012, 
 you had fully autonomous  drones making the Kell 
decision. 
 Even to some degree with  self driving cars,
 even a human making a  judgement at the end of the 
day and most of these  situations, 90%
 is coming direct  from machines
 so if the last step 
 is just to pull the  trigger or not,
 and if that is such a big  ethical conundrum for us,
 it should also be an ethical  conundrum that everything we 
are doing 
 is being filtered through  some sort of machine analysis 
or input.  
So even if a human is  making a decision,
 how much of the decision  is human? 
An example of that would  be the (unknown term)
 Northpoint problems  in the justice system,
 which was basically 
 the slab that developed  an algorithm
 that predicts the  (unknown term)
 for anyone appearing 
 for trial 
 and recidivism 
 means 
 somebody might commit  a crime again
 so judges often judge  based on that score.
 If you're not human, you can  completely ignore this if you 
think, but we are all biased 
 so the moment that they see  a high score, they are going 
to increase the bail  or denied bail. 
The problem is, I saw this  often happening with people 
of colour, specifically  black people.
 The whole thing 
 is that they are saying  that it is not racist
 but just the data is biased.  
 To your  first example
 or I guess one of the  examples was military,
 shoot decisions  are being made,
 artillery decisions  are being made
 based on data.  
Where does the data come from? 
 It is not 
 Sgt (unknown term) out there 
, 
 there is an assist in  providing the data.
 and it is being transferred  to you.
 So yes, 
 you're absolutely right. 
 We are 
 already making huge  decisions based on data 
provided by those machines. 
 I was two minutes  late starting class
 because my dad's  clock that I use
 is to minutes slow.  
 So even little  things like that
 can set you up. 
 
 Going back to the point  about the airplane
 and waiting 
 and how a lot of the  things in our lives
 are based on compromising  and having imperfect
 methods. 
 I was kind of thinking  about this
 and going beyond just  the airport lounge,
 I would assume that  these authors
 would say that really 
 if prediction was  completely perfect,
 then no one should  wait anywhere
 and there should be no 
 sort of waiting  rooms of any type.
 And your life should be plan  to the minute, which is kind 
of a crazy idea.  
I think if you took these  examples to the extreme,
 you would know exactly how  long it takes to do every 
single thing in your life  and so your whole life,
 if you used these prediction  machines, you wouldn't ever 
have to think about  timing again. 
 That's perfect.  
You have really hit something 
 that I wanted to  get into today
 and I wasn't sure  how to get there.
 As prediction improves, 
 what do we miss out on? 
 If you don't have to  go wait at the airport,
 example \'96 
 if I didn't have to sit  around and wait at the 
airport, I never would  have met this fellow
 who turned out to be  one of my dear friends.
 I never see him, we just  happened to me at the airport.
 If I was always on time or  if my 'Prediction Machines' 
to wait 
, I may not have  encountered him.
 What else could we miss 
 and how else with the  human experience change?
 if we did have  such prediction?
 
 One of the things I was told 
 as I was doing a remote  internship this summer, one 
of the CEOs was giving an  address and he said that one 
of the things he is said we  will miss the summer even 
though the internship will be  almost exact in the same as 
the conversations that you  hear in the hallway, or you 
run into someone that you  didn't happen to see in the 
office and they ask if you  want to shadow them for a 
meeting.  
Often times, that is how we  pick up information that is 
not taught through boot camp  training or whatever. 
That is often how we  sometimes get our big breaks, 
like I shadowed meetings and  I happened to catch my 
coworker at the right time  and it allowed me to do so 
many other cool projects.  
So there are chance moments  and chance encounters. 
They don't happen quite often  so maybe we wouldn't miss out 
that much but we  would miss out. 
 Serendipity is...  
Science would be very  much impacted by that. 
One of the reasons is,  someone in the class asked me
 to forgive their forwardness 
 but why did I stay  at IBM research
 or 35 years?  
I'm still there. 
 It is exactly what  Katerina just said.
 I can wander the halls there 
 and run into somebody 
 from a completely  different discipline
, country, culture, 
 anything. 
, 
 and get to know them. 
 Many research institutions  have
 major hallways 
 with a little alcove, 
 Google 
 and Microsoft both do this, 
 it is just a little alcove 
 with a (unknown term). 
 I cannot tell you how  many patent discussions
 I happened upon just by  walking past one of those
 and then jumping in 
 to contribute to  that conversation.
 So if the predictions  are better,
 maybe we will miss out  on some stuff like that.
 You are right, absolutely. 
 And what about scientific  discoveries?
 Penicillin. 
 That was an accident. 
 Post-it notes, 
 another accident. 
 If we had better prediction, 
 would we have missed that? 
 
 I was thinking about the  perfect planning aspect,
 there is the issue that 
 our example, 
 I have several disabled  family members
 so it takes them a lot  longer to get from a gate
 or a two gate B  at the airport. 
So the question is, do you  make everyone wait for that 
person?  
If you have a plan to the  minute, then you cannot 
accommodate those people.  
If you can accommodate them  then you have to make 
everyone else wait so the  question is, what prediction 
is the machine going to do?  
 Yes, and do you  dynamically adjust based on 
the passengers?  
Now small airlines and small  planes, like a jump Jets
 the ones that do short  hauls, I used to travel
 with a Vice President 
 who was really large. 
 In pretty much any dimension  you want to name.
 Brilliant guy, 
 but more than once when  travelling with him on a 
short hop, the pilots would  come back and say that this 
is a small plane so we  have to even of the load
 so sir, could you move  to the other side?
 He got it all of the time  and he was fine with it but 
even those were just the  last minute, based on the 
environment, based on the  situation, judgements that 
had to be made.  
 
 One more thing we lose with  the rise of electronics
 and always on communication, 
 downtime has gone down. 
 It is supposed to  increase leisure
 but overall, 
 it just increases the amount  of work we can do.
 Because now everything in  your life is partly planned
 so you don't have those  moments of downtime,
 you are just losing  these moments
 of peace in your life.  
 Yes, exactly. 
 I just lost the window 
 there it is. 
 So did anybody see  the movie O poss
 ' 
, I can't remember 
, 
 but it was an animated show 
 and it was in the far future 
 and it may have been a robot. 
 All of the humans were  in these huge spaceships
 going through space, 
 completely happy. 
 They had long since lost  their way in the stars
 and eventually realized 
 that they can do this stuff,  they can do something else.
 Long story, bad example. 
 OK. 
 
 I think the matter of  kind of losing things
 as a result of not  having downtime
 is to some degree 
 an issue of framing,  not completely.
 For example, 
 the example that you  mentioned about meeting a 
dear friend while at  the airport waiting
 \'96 certainly there could have  been a situation where
 if you had gone to your  destination earlier, there 
would have been someone you  met but by the time you got 
there, they were gone.  
So it is kind of hard to  predict how that will result 
in certain serendipitous  encounters. 
 
 Very good point.  
Are we exchange in one group  of serendipitous encounters 
for another?  
And thank you (Name),  the movie was
 walled Wl 
l 
W 
E . 
 
 I think there is an  argument to be made
 but if you reduce downtime 
 or we live in a society  where we are thinking about 
optimizing all of the time, 
 even if theoretically 
 you might not have to  wait at the airport
 but on the other side  you might meet someone,
 your mindset changes and  you are in a frame of mind
 where you are not  used to having
...  
Sartre, 
 -- sorry, 
 you are not used to  having any free time
 so you don't have 
 do necessarily wait on the  other side of the airplane.
 You get on the plane and  your car is already there
 and it is sort of like the  way of life it entirely 
 In the movie, 
 the idea was that systems  give you all of this leisure 
time.  
What are you going  to do with it?
 If all predictions are gone. 
 
 I guess for me, 
 the one main concern  I have is the fact that
 if we had a near 
 perfect 'Prediction Machines' 
 it would only really  espouse one
 perspective. 
 It would make many people 
 basically adhere to  potentially only a limited 
scope of ideas  and perspectives
 and the concern with  that is we saw
 in the movie, 
 maybe the prediction is wrong 
 or maybe there is something  else to do.
 I did not like  how the book said
 that humans in the future, 
 even though missing, 
 would be better at this,  we can input or data.
 I thought that was  a weird relationship,
 I still feel like people  should be building
 and creating things that the  AI could, even if it is 
better and more (unknown  term) because there may be 
things that the AI does  not know how to do. 
 Exacting, that  silly trolley problem comes 
up. 
 Or realistically, the Tesla.  
If you read the fine print  on today's Tesla,
 it says to keep their hands  on the wheel at all times 
even if you are not driving.  
Who is going to do that?  
 On the things that  we could potentially miss out 
on, I was kind of thinking  even beyond that, what if 
there is a point where 
 the machines have learned  from human experience, like 
what type of experiences  are valuable to people. 
And be able to predict  that this airport
 is where a lot of people  who travel alone go,
 or are looking to talk to  other people, maybe we should 
factor this in to how  we plan this persons
 -- predict what this  person's day is going to look 
like or predict where certain  spontaneous things can happen
 like in a lab and  make room for that.
 I like that. 
 The system, if you have a  system that plans or travel,
 it might listen to things  like that and also just some 
of your preferences.  
Not just airlines but  I don't like crowds
 or there needs to  be a good bar there,
 all sorts of other 
 subtle and not-so-subtle  biases.
 The systems don't allow  it, it just is.
 Like a voice recognition  system
 that I use a lot, 
 when I was training 
, 
 if I didn't use a good test 
 or didn't do it enough, 
 it was just as bad as  doing this with Watson.
 It came back and made  predictions that were just 
Was it my bad microphone,  was at the cold,
 who knows?  
But they learn and it is  the paperclip problem
, remember? 
 
 I just wanted to say 
 that I think that (Name)  makes an excellent point
 and this is kind of related  to (Name)'s point as well,
 there is kind of that  inherent problem with the 
optimization that it is 
 going to definitely be  taking certain things away.
 And it is not going  to serve everybody. 
This optimization is  something that is useful to 
specific people with  specific goals,
 usually the people with  the goal of making money.
 That is not necessarily  a bad goal
 but there are certainly  people who are willing to use 
that goal as something that 
 is to the extrusion  of others.
 So the application 
 of this optimization 
 is something that needs  to be examined.
 
 And what about competing  productions?
 Are we just going to  sit back and watch
 a battle of the titans  here when paired
 -- competing productions 
 (unknown term). 
 How do we resolve this? 
 
 Kind of veering off 
 it in a similar vein, 
 we kind of touched on this, 
 I can see it going both ways 
 that this kind of automation  would help people
 who are not like the norm. 
 Like if you are disabled 
 or if you are on the  autism spectrum,
 there are tools to help you  integrate into society better
 but I feel like overall,  these prediction machines
 will probably work to  exclude those people more
 because they are  not the norm.
 So in the case of a Tesla, 
 and we have to code  these preferences in
 so it depends on who is  coding their judgement.
 But in the case of a Tesla, 
 if you have to run over -- 
 if the Tesla has to crash 
 and it is going to choose to  kill a disabled person in a 
wheelchair or an able-bodied  person who was walking,
 how are we going to make  those decisions and how are 
we going to decide whose  life is more important?
 And I don't even know  if we can all --
 we keep talking about  human judgement
 as if there is something  that we all agree on
 but this is going to vary  immensely across cultures
 and around the world, so  that is another issue. 
 You folks are reading  between all the lines and 
picking up everything.  
The book even makes the point 
 that the prediction might not 
 be optimal 
 but only optimal, subject to  the constraints of the system 
was given. 
 So if the constraint is to  make sure that the person 
driving the car does not  get hurt then, alright.
 But what else does that mean? 
 What are the externalities? 
 Hey, there's a word! 
 
 I guess until now, 
 (unknown term) considers  these production machines
 independent things, 
 but we need to remember the  fact that someone is making 
them and profiting  off of them. 
Before big tech, I was  here at (unknown term)
 and more (unknown term) than  most places in the world.
 So I was in this future  of AI talk yesterday
 and I guess 
 someone asked me about the  fact that at this point,
 it is often tech companies  regulating governments
 the charge on privacy. 
 Instead of the  other way around.
 So the question is, 
 if prediction machines 
 get to a point where they  can start running our lives,
 is it even a decision that  we can collectively make?
 Is it possible to regulate  them if they get to that 
scale. 
 So if we allow them to get  to that scale without having 
a copperheads a plan, but it  is kind of the chicken and 
the egg problem. 
 
 You have really touched  on something
 that if I had 
 to specify a goal  for this course,
 so when you leave 
, when you finish this or  escape this, however you 
think about it, wherever you  go to work or whatever you do,
 there is going to be  an interest/pressure
 may be already underway 
 of (unknown term)  for systems.
 And a lot of people out  there are blind to the 
This is cool, look  what we can do. 
In this class, 
 we spent part of our time  playing with the technology
 and the rest of the  time thinking about
 how we should play with the  technology and where we 
should go without.  
And that's exactly  what I want.
 I want you to come out  of the end of this class
 understanding more about  cognitive systems and a 
little bit of a sceptic.  
Do we need a I hear and what  are the side effects?
 And that is a pretty good  walk into our first breakout.
 Shared screen, 
 and I am going to go ahead  and let everybody share.
 When we break up, 
 somebody always asks  to shared screen.
 There we go. 
 At least in the moment, 
 the human judgement is still  needed in lots of cases.
 where cognitive systems 
 are or may be 
 diploid. 
ye 
d. 
 Human judgement is still  required, at least we hope so,
 what are some of the  judgement needs in these 
other areas?  
And don't just think small, 
 try to think of the whole 
 environment. 
 Think of the externalities 
 as the book says. 
 In this case in particular, 
 think about the judgement \'96 
 how fast is a judgement  have to be here?
 If it is the Tesla barreling  down the road,
 it has to be pretty quick. 
 If it is vaccine allocation,  fast is good
 accurate is better. 
 Architectural projects, 
 all of these have a variety 
 of judgement needs 
 and externalities. 
 So let's take 10 
 to wander through this 
 and I am really anxious  to see what you think.
 I will put these choices 
 and slack 
 A little bit of snooping I  did, it certainly sounded 
interesting.  
What about the trucking  industry?
 Comments and thoughts  on that?
 Did anybody think about  trucking industry
, 
 I believe (Name) was  in the first group.
 Go ahead. 
 
 For example with the  trucking industry,
 there are some (unknown term) 
 that the cognitive system 
 can do. 
 and there are some things  that it cannot do.
 For example, 
 for the delivery industry 
, 
 it takes some food items  that wants to be delivered
 but there are some 
 real events that can occur, 
 like the package  might be damaged
 or there are some items 
 that are not properly  wrapped.
 At the same time, 
 the item may not 
 have some value 
 in there, 
 it may be something  (unknown term)
 that even if the  package is damage,
 the item might be good. 
 So in that case, 
 it might be that there  is some type of judgement
 that the system could take 
. 
 If there is a human, 
 then he or she can  inspect the package
 and decide whether it is 0K 
. 
 But a cognitive system 
 might not handle those things 
 as good as 
 a human can. 
 
 I see your point 
, let me pull on  that a little bit.
 My experience may be limited 
 with freight delivery 
 folks 
, they tend to want  nothing to do
 with complaints or whatever. 
 They are just  the deliveryman,
 if you have a problem, 
 you have to call  the big boss.
 Would that help? 
 Would a cognitive system  be able to help
 in situations like that 
 where 
 don't ask me, ask the boss. 
 
 I think at a certain  level it could work.
 If it is trained in some way 
 that if the item is  completely damaged
 or it is not working, then  you can just return it back
 and give some decision 
 or reimburse the cost for it. 
 But if there is  something like
 the item inside might be good 
 but the package  could be damage,
 so in such cases, 
 it has to make a  critical decision
 how it wants to 
 
 Interesting, 
 any other concerns with  the trucking industry can
 I admit, 
? 
 I admit, 
 I was thinking of situations  where drivers can make a 
decision based on feedback on  the data that they have got.
 Routes that they might take. 
, 
 monitoring 
 that they might be aware of. 
 Lots of stories there that  we don't have time for.
 OK, 
 some of the judgement would  have to be real-time in 
trucking because  stuff happens.
 Some of it may be 
 after-the-fact as well 
 so we will move on. 
 Mass transit design. 
 What are some of  the judgement calls
 that have to be made there? 
 We have the data 
 where the people are, 
 yes? 
 
 We kind of covered a couple  different points.
 One of the first  ones we talk about,
 which I think has been  a problem in the past,
 is designing a fair  and efficient system
 that doesn't have biases 
 towards different 
, 
 like being left 
s 
 intrusive on a wealthier  neighbourhood
. 
 Running it through  less wealthy areas
 and putting railroads 
 right through a city 
 or town. 
 We were talking about  how a cognitive system,
 you could design one that 
 doesn't have data points 
 on the wealth or  makeup of areas,
 it is just looking  geographically
 and tries to equally  distribute
 stations 
 where there is a  goal of efficiency,
 in terms of concentration  of individuals.
 And being as 
 limited and intrusive  as possible
 on the area 
 so that way, 
 it would not be biased 
 as I think a lot of designs  in the past have been.
 So that was kind  of one topic.
 Do you want to talk  about the other
, (Name)?  
 
 We also brought up the point  about buses in particular
 we talked about how  buses take one route
 so it is very  easy to automate
, 
 we are already implanting  self driving cars
 so self driving buses 
, especially when you're  taking one path
 and it is repetitive. 
 Obviously there are other  issues on the road
 but that could be  easily automated.
 And also already  a lot of subways
 are kind of pushing towards  that direction, where maybe 
they have a conductor there  in case of emergencies.
 But we are already seeing  this push towards automation
 and less human judgement. 
 Very good. 
 Particularly in subways 
 because in any kind of rail, 
 in subways you tend 
 to not have stuff  on the rails.
 In regular rail delivery, 
 you have occasionally a car 
 or a cow or something. 
 But it seemed like  a good place to start
 and some critics have said 
 that they don't even  have that right yet,
 how could we automate cars? 
 It's interesting 
. 
 All of that judgement 
 would not have  to be real time
 because you are designing, 
 you are planning. 
 And to Jason's point, 
 assuming that your  cognitive system
 is not provided  with biased data,
 suppose it is only  presented with
 the demographics of  who might be using
 or might need 
 the mass transit, 
 and nothing about income, 
 price of land, 
 because 
 the imminent domain,  as you said,
 Would it be better designed? 
 I really wonder. 
 With that sort of 
 clinical machine  level evaluation
 come up with something  better?
 What sort of data  would be missing?
 Would you have to  include in that data
 where new office parks 
 or office buildings  are being planned?
 You can only guess where  it is going to be next.
 That is a tough one.  
Resource management, anyone  have comments on that?
 We all believe in it 
 but can we get some help 
 because we are not  doing a good job. 
(Laughs) Any thoughts?  
 One of the examples  our group talked about
 as I think similar to  the mass transit group,
 who is really driving the 
Who are we optimizing for?  
So for example, 
 if we are optimizing  water resource,
 are we optimizing for Nestl\'e9  to maximize profits connect
 are we optimizing for other  people who drink water?
 It also applies to things  like forest in to a lesser 
effect, how do we value the  prophet off of (unknown term)
 if this is the secret  land or some people?
 So some of those human  judgements or value judgements
 are harder to code 
 and include 
 when a lot of the systems 
 are built by the people 
 who stand to profit. 
 
 You raise a good one, 
 I like your example about  forestry management
 because when people 
 say 
 that we need to have  a controlled burn
 in this area in California 
 because all of the  models tell us
 that is the right  thing to do,
 that is controversial. 
 Some people think 
 that 
 mother nature should do it, 
 but mother nature is not  causing the problem here.
 What if 
 AI said you have  to go burn this
 and it was smart, 
 how would people  react to that?
 Probably not too well. 
 Waste management  and recycling,
 does anyone have  any comments there?
 When a cognitive system  help us there?
 We talked about this a bit 
 and we have to start  out with the fact that
 recycling is fake 
 and everything we have  been told is a lie.
 So background for those  who don't know,
 recycling was a scam  from the very beginning
 and it only worked  for a while
 because we were trying to  have high economic growth
 so they push up the price  of plastic to high levels
.  
So it was actually worth it  to take plastic from recycling
 and reform it and use it. 
 The problem is as economic  growth in China has slowed 
down, the price of (Laughs)  Has plunge, and it is no 
So two or three years ago  China decided that they would 
not be in parting plastic  anymore which also means
 that recycling doesn't work  when no one wants to process 
it.  
So most of it ends  up in a landfill.
 So we thought that if we  could improve the system of 
sorting, sorting different  types of plastic to maybe 
create a system that is  cheaper in terms of 
processing, we would probably  be able to take up a bit more 
plastic out of the system.  
Plastic is cheap, recycled  plastic is extensive. 
So there is only so many ways  that you can make the process 
cheaper so at the end of the  day, if the plastic is not 
going to be worth it, no one  is going to process it 
No matter how cheap  we make the process. 
The group members had some  thoughts on the subject. 
 I had a bit of  a follow-up question \'96
 I am not entirely sure how  this connects back to it 
being a scam?  
Certainly, it is not entirely  altruistically
 intended.  
That much is clear. 
 But I am not sure if scam,  that seems to have a value 
 That is  beyond the scope of
 cognitive systems, perhaps  you can take this off-line?
 (Laughs) Indeed, 
 maybe the cognitive  system would tell us
 where we should and  shouldn't use plastic
 or where we could make  reductions and so on.
 Vaccine allocation, 
 I hope this was  not too exciting?
 Did anyone talk about that? 
 
 I was in the group for this 
 and one of the persons  we spoke about
 was basically just  re-mining the system
 that we currently have. 
 Identifying 
 who needs a vaccine. 
 Clearly the entire time, 
 there has been a focus on 
 trying to determine who  needs to get the vaccine first
 and so on.  
 to be able to make more  accurate predictions
 is going to be incredibly  useful to that end
 and further, it could  help correct some of the
 inefficiencies in the system 
 so that people don't  miss appointments
 or get turned away when they  think they are about to get 
 At the same time 
, something else  we talked about
 was how we would form 
 phases or classes of people 
 and whether or not 
 that is something  a cognitive system
 could make the  judgement calls.
 And what it reminded  me of kind of
 was how we have been talking  about more generally
 like how you say people 
 and how that is a common  problem when it comes to 
cognitive systems, whether  or not the system would 
privilege young people who,  with the vaccine, have a much 
higher chance of living  versus privileging those were 
at higher risk and  giving a priority. 
 Yes, 
 it is not clear that the  world is ready to hand out 
that judgement call.  
(Laughs) OK, good. 
 Road and Highway design, 
 where their thoughts there? 
 
 We thought that AI is pretty  good with numbers,
 it is going to be great  at numbers in physics,
 planning or optimizing  routes,
 so that is a no-brainer  for Highway design.
 We got into a  discussion about
 this article 
 where scientists found  that certain amoebas
, if you put them on a map 
 where certain Metros are in  the city and watch them grow,
 you end up with pretty  amazing routes
 for how to plan highways  in cities.
 So I guess one discussion  we ran into
 was, are we -- 
 in the next five years, 
 are we going to start  looking to AI to solve all 
problems or will there be 
 simpler and easier  solutions around us?
 
 We need judgement about  the judgement system
 here last month 
. 
 Customers used to say could  you pour a little crypto on 
this to make it more secure  and of course, that's crazy.
 Now they are saying 
 can you pour a little a  illness and improve my bottom 
line.  
 
 We were saying that human  positions could come in
 when we were talking  about aesthetics
 and different preferences  and looking at the design
.  
Already 
 cognitive systems  could handle
 streamlining the design, 
 the more detail  we are getting
 than the better 
 it will be able to 
 process 
 the information 
. 
 Probably a lot better  than a human could.
 
 Identifying the data that  the expert designers
 and the city planners use 
 is sometimes tough. 
 It is not just numbers, 
 it might be opinions, 
 it may be any number  of external factors.
 
 Exactly, that was part  of my point as well.
 Obviously it is  good at numbers
 but I think in this  kind of domain, AI
 is only as effective as 
 the experts can give it the  appropriate training data.
 Especially because 
 there are obviously other  considerations outside of 
traffic flow, in terms  of optimizing a highway.
 For exhibit, you wanted to  be accessible to a large 
amount of people 
 and you don't want to be  spreading across communities
 or discuss 
 -- disturbing resource flows. 
 If they take in account 
 a large variety of factors  and different populations,
 then with the computing power 
 and the abilities it  is certainly viable.
 But you do need the baseline 
 human attached thereto, to  really articulate that 
 
 More of a bottling process 
 tempered with social. 
 Architecture, 
 city design, 
 that is also going to have  some of the people aesthetic 
 Where there any discussion  points there?
 
 I totally agree 
 that it is a slamdunk 
 where we still value  human judgement
 for architectural projects 
 because what we really see  or appreciate in these 
projects is the architectural  eye.
 But an addendum to that, 
 we could use AI 
 to try and make 
 patterns that we see as  aesthetically pleasing
 within architectural  projects.
 For exhibit, 
 in at arches and curves 
 within something  that is appreciated
 and trying to emulate those  and other projects.
 What is most valued is human  in architectural project.
 
 Like in Hawaii, 
 if you ever fly into their, 
 odds are that you will land  at the Honolulu airport
 and it pretty much doesn't  have any walls.
 It is kind of open, or at  least the last time I was 
there. 
 They don't need it. 
 But then there  are other things
 like, 
 right there behind you 
 is a lovely plant climbing  up the wall there.
 If that is considered  a positive aesthetic,
 then the cognitive  system might say
 we are designing this  apartment block here
 and so they all have  to have planters
 because Tyler's example 
 shows everybody needs plants. 
 So you have to be careful  with your training data,
 it all comes back to  the training data.
 Last one and probably  the scariest one \'96
 monitoring social media.  
Can we bought that 
 or do people have  to be about?
 
 We discussed mainly  two things
. 
 The first thing was  the content of sarcasm
 and certain figures of speech 
 because you can say  the same phrase
 into complete lead  different contexts.
 One of them can be a joke 
 and the other could be  something horribly offensive.
 So having an automated  content monitor
 could tag both or neither,  or even the wrong one.
 We also discussed almost  a benefit of it
 which would be with  the current system,
 there are human moderators 
 and there is a ton of mental  health consequences
 for those moderators. 
 I think it was last year,  Facebook settled a massive 
lawsuit.  
with their moderators 
 so that could be a benefit  of a strong automated 
moderator.  
 Yes, I mean, 
 solving a real human  shortcoming \'96
 I don't want to say  shortcoming but limitation \'96
 you can only deal  with this so much.
 Some topics are easier  than others.
 I encountered one fellow 
 who, when we were doing  an ethical hack,
 we found a large collection  of pictures
, 
 gigabytes of pictures 
.  
We were all going for lunch  and he said he was going to 
stay behind so I asked why,  and he said he wanted to make 
sure that they were all  pornographic pictures. 
(Laughs) So he clicked  everyone of them to decide is 
But it was next definition of  what is a naughty picture.
 People have tried for years 
 to identify on social media, 
 when is this offensive? 
 Tricky. 
 I didn't raise  the art question
 because I only wanted  eight groups
 but that is a big one. 
 And finally, we didn't get  to the second breakout
 because you guys  think so well,
 what about the externalities? 
 In the trucking industry, 
 externalities. 
 When you 
 cognitive eyes 
 the trucking industry, 
 one of the second and  third layer affects?
 How would gas  stations change?
 How would hi way use change? 
 What would happen to diners 
 and so on. 
 Resource management, 
 if all of a sudden we  started doing a better job,
 what are the externalities  here? 
Can we handle the water?  
For example, solar and  renewables are great
 but early systems found out 
 that if the supply of  energy is not steady,
 or at least predictable, 
 the grid can handle it. 
 If it surges up and down 
 like solar can, 
 it is more difficult 
 to incorporate  into the jargon.
rid 
. 
 Highway design and  externalities,
 we talked about that. 
 How does it impact  neighbourhoods,
 what does it do with  resource flow?
 What are you going  to do here?
 And of course, monitoring  social media
 is the big brother 
 looking over your shoulder  on everything you type.
 In sending you messages 
 saying not to do that again. 
 I don't know, 
 but externalities are often 
 not considered. 
 Any other thoughts  on externalities
 or example scheme act 
s 
? 
 Somebody needs to say  something about externalities.
 Tracy hasn't spoken. 
 Rachel, 
 anybody? 
 We are losing people already. 
 There's Tracy! 
 I don't know  if it is an externality
 but with the social  media monitoring,
 I think it can definitely  bridge into 1984
 like how do we decide  what is Katie say?
 Freedom of speech  and all of that.
 I think that is a hard thing  to draw a hard line on.
 Very true, 
 that goes to the (unknown  term) for judgement. 
Somebody's judgement. 
 What side effect  would there be,
 what externality would it be 
 if social media started 
 getting 
 big brother 
e 
d? 
 Would people stop using it? 
 
 I think you can definitely  change the way people think
 and I don't know, 
 it can converge  everyone's ideas
 to what one certain path. 
 At least everyone who uses  a certain platform may be,
 it could alienate some views. 
 Mind control. 
 And Joseph has a comment. 
 
 Just a quick thing, 
 to everyone 
 -- I would find everyone  who disagrees with me
 and get myself elected  every time.
 If election results come out  the way I don't like it,
 who would know if  I control the media?
 So it sounds pretty fun.  
 Some countries are  trying to practice that 
 Alright, I will let you out  about three minutes early.
 This has been fascinating  as always.
 A couple of things  coming up \'96
 Monday we have (Name), 
 he is an IBM 
 and has been teaching Watson  longer than there has been 
Watson. 
 He will talk about  new cool tools
 that various companies  in the industry
 have a to help come up with 
 the (unknown term). 
 And then we have  (unknown term)
 talking about  ethics and bias.
 And then Friday  we have a quiz,
 I will be posting guidelines  on the quiz.
 A little bit further  in the future,
 a week from Monday, 
 we have project to debater. 
 This is a bunch of IBM people 
 in it (unknown term) 
 who came up with  a bunch of people
 -- a system that could  viably complete
 with the world's Champion  debate participant.
 Prior to that talk, 
 you must read the article 
. 
 I posted it and I  will post it again
 but he is going to assume  that you read that article
 because like a typical  researcher, he doesn't want 
to bother with the little  things in the details and 
stuff, he wants to get  to the big thoughts.
 So I promised him everybody  would have read the article, 
so please plan on that.  
a week from Monday.  
With that, I have wasted  another three minutes of your
