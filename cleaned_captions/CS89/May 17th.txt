 Well done. 
 A question I have \'96 
 the businesses that start 
 losing traffic, 
 do you have any plan 
 for letting them know? 
 Or is this really just 
 a point just for me. 
 
 That is something we had thought  about.
 There is definitely opportunity 
, in sort of a longer-term setting, 
 I think in the same way that you  can provide better and more detailed 
insight for consumers, you could  probably also provide
 more important insights 
 to businesses 
 about what they can improve more  specific leave.
 That could also be sort of 
 another service 
 that you could sell on both sides  as well.
 If you are providing more detailed  data than other (unknown term) would 

 One of the things that I would  suggest
 is that when you do sentiment  analysis,
 a lot of times there are also tools  in order to be able to
 take like the top keywords, 
 the ones that are most associated  with positive emotions or negative 
emotions, and you might be able to  take those and figure out
 like what do people most complain  about about the business or what is 
the business doing best.  And you could probably put that 
together in some sort of format and  also sell it to the businesses. Say 
you are doing well at this and this,  and badly at this and this, if you 
 

 I wanted to talk about the  potential of having (unknown term) 
reviews.  I know you're you're using yelp, and 
they have died to get rid of fake  reviews but under the assumption 
that there will be some in your  training model, is there anything 
you're thinking about to get rid of  them? There could be some type of 
sentiment that is too extreme, may  be getting rid of it, or is that 
 I think 
that is an issue that we can look  at. I think maybe in the context of 
sort of the prototype, that might be  something that we might not get a 
chance to take a look at.  But I think we have to look into the 
viability and sort of focus on  getting the (unknown term) 
demonstrated with technology prior  to that. That is deftly something we 
 Alright, cool. Thank you 
very much, team two.  Let's move on.
 Team three is here somewhere! 
 
 Hi, we are team three. 
 You can go to the next slide,  please.
 I am sure most of us remember 
 kind of what happened in February 
 when the stock market was  essentially rocked
 by regular people essentially 
 communicating outside rabbit 
 read it. 
 To blot the stock market. 
 And while it is true well 
 apps like Robin Hood have increase  the accessibility, there is still a 
large knowledge gap 
 and access in a billable  information, so that is the problem 

 Our solution is an app 
 that offers recommendations on  people looking to invest.
 We make sure to make another  knowledgebase
 and to communicate risks associated  with their stock
, and to tell them the probabilities  of getting a high return.
 The basic user flow would be that a  user tells us a stock that they are 
interested in and we will provide  them with recent views and general 

 The overall question 
 that we are having our machines  solve
 is the risk of a given stock-based 
 on an individual's situation. 
 So the prediction is really 
 the metrics about risk 
 in the stock in question, 
 along with the individual's  financial information.
 The judgement is how we are going  to evaluate different
 errors, and first of all, 
 if the user generally has more  knowledge about their investments
 then that is going to be access. 
 So if we give them information that  is going to be very relevant to them.
 We know a lot of stock apps like  Robin Hood are very
 game if I'd so we want to make sure  that the stocks are
 presented in a more reasonable way,  so there is no hype around it.
 We are going to recommend to invest  or not invest
 in we were thinking of doing like  different categories
 and to categorize the stock for a  person, like risky
, very risky, not risky.  Those types of categories.
 For data that we will need to train, 
 we will have financial data on  different stocks
 and information about how  portfolios have performed.
 And also information about what  types of stocks
 different age groups should be  investing in.
 Silver outcome, 
 it is really feedback from the user. 
 How often does the user take the  advice of the stock but
 in in terms of improving the  algorithm,
 we will be able to update a base on  the user feedback,
 in terms of how the user takes the  advice
 and also just to update it as the  economy changes. And how different 
stock can perform over time. 
 
 Stockpot is designed 
 to offer the best of both worlds 
, 
 so it is highly transparent 
. 
 As we talked about, daytrading apps 
 with literally no fees are very  popular
 but it is often (unknown term),  leading to risky traits
 and users. 
 Users in total control of their per  folio
 but without adequate understanding  to know exactly what they are 
getting into. 
 (unknown term) also exist 
 but do not allow the same type of  portfolio customization
 as these trading apps. 
 So our own goal here 
 is to allow the user to build their  own poem for Leo,
 selecting individual shares 
 for other investment opportunities 
, while being aware of the risk that  each stock carries.
 
 Meets users at their knowledge  base, what does that mean?
 
 We were thinking that for our  knowledge base,
 we are going to assume not very  much knowledge.
 And also we are going to have the  user put in general information
 about their current financial  state, like how open they are,
 what their goals are, and then  provide them with sources

 You could even be as bold as if it  is an old person like me,
 then you might say that you are  interested probably in low risk. And 
if you are young college graduate,  you might be interested in a little 
more risk.  Since you have time to recover. So 
that's how you assess user skill  levels, you ask him.
 them? 
 Restaurant parents, what you mean  by that?
 
 Is not necessarily that we are risk  transparent,
 we are making whatever platform  people are using
 our risk transparent. 
 Eventually if you actually built as, 
 you could parent with an app like  Robin Hood
 to help assess risk. 
 But in this case at least, 
 the idea is that the user 
 is easily able to trade 
 and we are trying to make it as  easy as possible to understand the 
risk of those trades using our plat  form. Electric
 
 Anybody else? 
 It's very good to 
 differentiate yourself from other 
 (unknown term) traders. 
 OK, 
 team Florida somewhere on the  stream.
 
 This is ago really exciting idea,  you guys are really onto something.
 Would you say it is  barely unique?
 Definitely. 
 There is a need for (unknown term)  to have this for sure.
 And even in the institutional  investor and trader space,
 despite all of the industry's  efforts
 kind of filtering information  earlier, there something in your 
slides that suggests that it is  still a big unmet need.
 So there is a lot of room for your  idea to grow from just the 

 Team four. 
 
 Our idea is quoted eight 
 and first of all, I will just do a  little overview of what we are 
trying to do here.  It is essentially movie 
identification and recommendation  application.
 It is essentially shazam for movies, 
 where a user 
 could use a web interface or a  smart farm
phone 
 and they have a movie that they  just cannot remember the name of,
 we would produce the movie for them  as well as provide recommendations
 based on a sentimental analysis  about the input they give us
 as well as 
 the corpus of movies that we  analyse.
 First of all, 
 just talking through prediction. 
 What we are really doing and 
 is taking in this quote 
 and predicting a movie name 
, based on natural language  understanding of the Watson system.
 And in addition, he thought it  would be a fun addition to this tool
 and hopefully we get to this scope  for our project is to do a sentiment 
analysis of not just positive and  negative, but different emotions 
attributed with that quote.  As well as for quotes within our 
database to predict some other  movies that you might enjoy.
 And quickly, kind of thinking about  the competitive landscape here,
 through our research, there really  is not a tool that does this.
 In terms of the speech to text  capabilities
 as well as using sentiment analysis  as a robustness check.
 There are a couple of websites 
 where you can type in a quote online 
 but we think this would be a much  more accessible and fun way
 for people to interact with their  movies.
 And essentially have this kind of  simple but useful tool
 at the tip of their fingers. 
 
 In terms of judgement, 
 so we are basically considering 
 the trade-off between in correctly  identifying a movie
 or not being able to predict one at  all due to low confidence
 level.  We found that it is better to
 not label a movie incorrectly, as  opposed to
 just saying that you were not able  to predict it.
 For action, really the two things  we are providing
 a movie with its corresponding  information.
 So we plan to display information  such as Cas, runtime,
 IMDb page, 
 so they have context about what the  movie is.
 The second thing is based off the  sentiment analysis,
 we plan to recommend three 
 up to five similar movies based on  the tone that we analysed
 from a given clipper audio input. 
 
 To measure the outcome we plan to  use the accuracy rate,
 so we can measure false positives  and negatives
 and figure out somehow how to  proceed.
 We also might incorporate 
 a way to gauge the user  satisfaction levels
 after we provide a recommendation. 
 Could you go to the next side? 
 In any input that we will be using  is
 Cornell's movie dialogues corpus, 
 which contains about 22,000 movie  quotes
 from a little over 
 600 different... 
 
 From the training, 
 we use (unknown term) 
 so there is that 
 course and also the movie name. 
 We use the data set to train the  model
 and after that, 
 we use the user input to test it 
 and we collect the feedback. 
 How the users are set if I 
 with our model 
. 
 And we try to predict 
 which movies are (unknown term) and  try to identify it,
 according to the users quote. 
 Based on that, we also think about  how it would be beneficial for the 
business.  In times of business,
 there should be better accuracy and  better prediction, so we
 need to fix those issues 
 (unknown term). 
 And make any change in the work  flow if necessary.
 We want to make the businessmen  beneficial for that purpose.
 Thank you. 
 
 It is a great idea, no doubt. 
 In the corpus is a wonderful choice. 
 You are going to get all of this  free labour,
 all of this free information. 
 You have to find a way to sell it. 
 No one is going to take you to  court over invading their privacy
 but the idea is that hey, these  movies get a lot of attention.
 So you need to think more about  that.\\
 The first question I had was 
 so if I typed in do, or do not,  there is no try,
 you would come back with the owner. 
 (unknown term) and the movie. 
 How does sentiment on mood driving  movie recommendation?
 So if I say Star Wars 
 return of the Jedi, 
? 
 
 I think this is more 
 kind of a feature that we are  trying to add.
 The real crux of what we are adding  is the identification.
 This was just an additional feature  which we kind of conceived of
 to further differentiate ourselves  from competitors, in terms of 
offering a more robust product to  the user base.
 But I think our idea there was to  mess around and to see if it was 
possible to include this and if not  in terms of recommendations, at 
least in terms of having additional  variable with spoken input
 in which we can gauge the tone of  the user. So
 instead of typing in text, we have  additional data point there to 
compare attacks.  But it is a great point.
 I'm not sure if it would assess an  entire movie script but...
 It is a data point that  you almost get for free.
 Alright, sounds like fun.  Thank you.
 We will go from team for 
 two team five. 
 
 So the question that motivated our  team
 is thinking about 
 how can we better serve students 
 who might be from international or  foreign backwards
 in this virtual learning  environment.
 Our thought is to build a solution  that makes learning to recorded 
lectures not accessible for students  who might intuitively think
 in a non-English language.  So our objective is to clarify
 learning for them, so he calls  ourselves
 (unknown term). 
 The idea is to take lecture  recordings and transcripts, such as 
those provided by Panopto, and  process them into summary notes
 in a student's native language.  I know that I sometimes take notes
 in my groupmates as well 
 in the language that we grew up with 
 and being able to automate that  would make things better.
 So our prediction is basically to  solve this uncertainty.
 In the student's native language, 
 what were the important points said  in class?
 And the payoff 
 that we have to think about the  trade-offs on
 our students learn better from  notes in their native language,
 but if we get it wrong 
 with our production or our  translation,
 then the student would not benefit 
 from improved efficiency of  learning.
 Thankfully, they can kind of recover 
 because this is not their only way  to get information.
 So it isn't like a medical diagnosis 
 where the downside is really bad  but at the same time,
 we do not want to be wrong.  We do not want to convert a +2 A-
 in someone's equation, in a  conceptual sense. The idea is to 
present a translated summary to the  user to enhance their learning
 and the outcome is really based on  customer satisfaction,
 regarding the summarization's and  translations that we provide to them.
 And then for the training 
 we will be using lecture transcripts 
 that we get from 
 (unknown term) in the class we are  in. Luckily in our group,
 we do have several group members  who English is not their first 
language so they can be the guinea  pigs for testing the output
 to see if it is helpful. 
 Once we get the summarized points, 
 we go ahead and add vernacular 
 or vocabulary that may be  specialized to the subject,
 to help improve transition quality. 
 And then run it through Watson's  translator.
 For our feedback, 
 we are having 
 user 
 feed feedback back into our model 
 with just a simple positive or  negative, so we can refine the 
models translation for how we are  summarizing. The workflow that we 
really envisioned as we are not  taking about this to be some super 
target back part of virtual learning  but definitely
 an augmentation to our current  setup.
 So not only do we really want this  to be a product
 that makes it easier for people who  might not be a native English 
speaker, so interact with the  lecture notes in his Pacific way,
 but also for people who might be  differently abled in my not be able 
to hear. 
 Or people who can physically take  notes, this would be a different 
resource for them.  Making the
 Syrians more successful for  everyone.
 That's it for us, 
 anyone have any questions for us? 
 
 Have you checked whether Watson can  translate the languages you are 
interested in?  Yes, OK, good.
 
 We need to check that. 
 
 Great name, great project. 
 While, very useful. 
 Team six is... 
 I see it somewhere on here. 
 
 We are the accent recognition group. 
 Our project or goal 
 is going to be to recognize accents 
 in the English language 
 using Watson. 
 
 The idea behind this is basically 
 given an unknown speaker 
 that we have the voice recording of, 
 can we determine any information  about the speaker
 like maybe there likely gender or  place of origin,
 even within the United States 
 could we determine the difference  between a Boston or New York accent.
 We will combine speech recognition  tool and some speech
 (unknown term). 
 
 Our use cases 
, we have a few of them. 
 We are going to be gathering accent  data
 and one of the possible 
 use cases could be together it on  local communities in the United 
States.  These accents probably would not be
 information on American accents,  but would probably be information on
 worldwide accents. 
 Maybe forest future census data or  something.
 Another use case could be 
 if you do not have a video 
 of a crime or something, 
 but you have an audio recording for  some reason,
 you could match a voice with the  general idea of someone's origin
 or what they might look like 
 based off of some sort of bias that  we may have
 about someone's accent. 
 Or gender, as we said before, 
 and that could be used in future  crime investigation.
 
 Our business plan. 
 Basically we have a bit of a who,  what, when, where, why.
 Ideally we would be presenting this 
 to the US government, 
 and some sort of contract or  something.
 And obviously we are ready talked  about this,
 accent recognition and English  accents, specifically.
 Because we are in the United States 
. 
 When 
 is we could do it in a census year 
 or if there is a crime  investigation and need.
 And why is this important? 
 Obviously data collection 
 is something that anyone could  benefit from
 and there is a lot of data these  days
 that we may not know are useful 
 about people find them useful in  the future.
 And it is always important to keep  track of these
 pieces of data. 
 And how are we going to do this? 
 We are going to use Watson speech  recognition
 and probably a custom machine  learning model
 for some sort of categorization  task.
 
 I am just owing to give a brief  overview, since we already talked 
but a lot of these boxes.  But given the voice, we want to 
predict the accent, to be the  geographical origin. In order to 
give the user more data about the  speaker just generally, what ever 
they are trying to determine about  the audio recording of the person 
speaking. 
 Depending on the use case, there  may be no issues with the judgement
 but we can imagine in misjudgment  in the case of a crime,
 it could also bring a lot of  issues. But you kind of mitigate that
 we want to have an F1 score of  higher than .7. We are always trying 
to beat that but that is the  baseline we want to get to adverse. 
We found a data set online where we  have a lot of different audio 
recordings online that have accents,  not just a people who were born 
outside of the United States and  have an exit speaking English but 
also regional dialects across the  United States. Like a California or 
a Boston accent so we do have that  database. And to test how that works,
 have a lot of friends on campus who  have accent speaking English, so we 
will get the recordings to see how  well the model works. If our AI's 
miss classifying certain accents in  particular, I have a California 
accent so I am very obvious when I  speak, we are going to focus on the 
areas that it's making mistakes on  to improve it. How does it impact 
our overall workflow?  This is really the marriage of 
machine learning and human  intelligence, so it is not going to 
replace humans in a crime  investigation sense, it is just 
going to augment the human  intelligence and give the user a 
little bit more data then maybe they  could classify on their own. And 
 Very interesting. In 
today's world, gender might be a  little tricky.
 I mean it is difficult to define,... 
 
 That's why we say gender, not sex, 
 because sex is someone's 
 biological 
... 
 
 This one is cool 
 and I can see its use, 
 especially in law enforcement and  so on.
 It is also borderline creepy 
 (Laughs) 
 Because it could be used to drive  bias.
 I can imagine that we have all had  experiences
 where we call a helpdesk 
 and we get someone with an accent 
 that we are not used to,. 
 There is nothing wrong with it,  we're just not used to it.
 And you just hang up and try again,  hoping to get some many different
 with a different accent.  And I think this happens worldwide.
 Folks in India don't like to hear  an American accent.
 A British accent might be A-OK and  so on.
 Wow, 
 never seen one like this either. 
 I'm very curious as to 
 what your training data is going to  look like.
 Thank you, team six. 
 Team seven! 
 Not sure how to pronounce that. 
 
 Our project is called AI got you 
 and our team is me, (Name), 
 (Name), and Stuart. 
 And the problem that we wanted to  talk about
 was that there are a bunch of  resources on campus
 that students may not have heard  of. There are common resources like
 security, housing, 
 but there are also things like 
 (unknown term) 
 which is to help you write your  essays for your classes
.  And I had not heard of this until my 
sophomore year 
 and there is probably tons of  campus resources that I still have 
not heard of and no one wants to  send lengthy emails
 asking around about resources. 
 Or even send an email to the one  person. At least,
 I would much rather ask a chat bot  to ask you
 any questions I might have. 
 
 We want to create a chat bot 
 that can direct students to the  appropriate services that they need 
to succeed.  That chat bot would predict what is 
the best resource to connect  students to, depending on the 
situation they describe.  In terms of our judgement, one of 
the biggest clarifiers that we have  is if it is in any sort of emergency 
system, that they should be calling  911 and not addressing our chat bot. 
If you have a false positive where  we direct them to a resource they 
don't need, at the very least, at  least they are aware of the new 
resource or they can be directed to  the right location. We want to avoid 
a false negative the most because we  do not want students to assume there 
is not a resource available to them,  when in reality there is. So the AI 
will choose from available services,  or exam, if students are talking 
about how they are having trouble  keeping up with reading and classes, 
I can instruct them to a  speed-reading course in Derby. In 
our outcome, we can evaluate with  (unknown term), seeing if offices 
are reporting that people are being  directed to them from the chat bot. 
And in training, we could ask the  jargon racket they could give us 
scenarios in which they want  students to be directed to them. And 
the input would be a student giving  their discretion of what help they 
need and feedback and also again,  come from the offices on campus or 
students report that they were able  to find a service for our chat bot. 
RAI will impact workload by  directing more traffic to them but 
not necessarily providing the  resources ourselves, we are just 
telling the students were to get  them. So if these offices find their 
having more students directed to  them, they will need to hire more 
 The way that this is 
normally done right now is people  have to go to orientation, that is 
kinda problematic because most of  the time, most of you don't remember 
what happened in orientation.  It is also difficult to go to 
orientation because it is difficult  to stay awake. Alternatively, people 
send emails to professors but we  have already talked about how 
inconvenient that is in some people  have email anxiety. Sometimes Chat 
bots stay awake all the time,.  You can reach out to peers or 
classmates and while that may be  almost always available and pretty 
easy to access, often times peers  will give you inaccurate 
information.  So we want the chat bot to give you 
accurate information.  So we think our chat bot is able to 
meet these four metrics that we  think is important to give 

 Our primary target for this is just  convenience. We envision with this
 that students will not have to send  awkward emails
 or go through all their emails 
 to find brief messages about  resources on campus.
 So just like we could ask Siri what  is the weather,
 you can ask our app where you go to  pay taxes, or basic questions.
 And with this, 
 we envision a pretty easy growth  model.
 It can be generalized to a lot of  schools
 and universities across the world. 
 You could either market to  institutions,
 where you can customize it  specifically for that school.
 And then they operate as a general  tool to all the students
 or students can sign up  individually.
 And then it is input based off of  that.
 Based off of their specific  resources.
 Beautiful! 
 And you call it 
 hey (unknown term), 
. 
 Any questions, folks? 
 Who would use this? 
 I would, 
 (Laughs) 
 And your point about 
 orientation 
 is well-made. 
 While we all had to go to it, 
 it is one of those forget at the  door kinds of things unfortunately.
 Team seven, I like it.  Very good.
 And team eight is here. 
 
 We are pitching our idea 
 which is the higher bought. 
 It stems from a problem that almost  all college students have had
 which is that many job obligations,  when you drop off your application, 
it turns into a black hole and you  never hear from them again.
 The root cause of that problem is  that large employers often get 
thousands or tens of thousands of  applications for position. Our 
solution to this is a I bought that  could cut down on the path -- time 
required to process the applications  and also constrained the process for 
buyer bias.  We could parse resumes for metadata,
 actually interviewing the candidate  via chat bot interface,
 as well as evaluating referrals  using Watson sentiment analysis.
 All of this could produce a score  for the applicant
 as well as a summary of what their  positive and negative 
characteristics are, they could then  be passed to a human operator. 
 As business, the main  competitors are going to be job 
marketplaces such as indeed, that do  kind of screening on appointment 
data.  But the unique value that we are 
going to be able to offer is the  integration of the AI.
 Basically, it is going to allow for  more robust evaluation of candidates
, considering more information in  less time.
 The main clients are going to be  companies with relatively large 
numbers of applications.  Likely
 a set fee with usage of the system,  rather than a per application charge 
because that is exactly the sort of  thing that these company's wood when 
you wanting to save on. 
 This is in winter the radiologist  Assistant where it is providing 
information to someone who is making  the decision but it is not 
exercising the judgement, so we take  this information into account and 
then use that to make a decision.  That's it for this slide.
 **Audio lost** 
 
 ...  Success by the relevant
... 
 **Audio lost** 
 
 That is a particularly nice one 
 because so many people 
 with IBM, Google, and I never hear  anything.
 With nothing else, the quick  response from a chat bot
 to provide information on the  submission would be good.
 In the interest of time, I just  have a couple of quick comments.
 Yes, you could even scan social  media.
 Most employers do that. 
 And as you pointed out, 
 you have to watch out for bias  creeping in.
 Not just because 
 you are looking at old employees  are existing employees,
 but things like poor grammar., 
 proper language use, 
 things like that. 
 And you will want to make sure that  your cognitive system can tell you
 that it is recommend something 
 based off of 
 one thing, 
 versus HBCUs is historically black  colleges
 with (unknown term) 
. 
 The goal is to hire the best people  and make your you have a diverse
 hiring tool. 
 Companies deal with this a lot, 
 it is a very complicated scoring  system.
 It's not just for the job, it is  also for diversity and avoiding bias.
 Every year 
 I think we can do something cooler 
 but we always do. 
 OK, team nine. 
 
 Hi everyone. 
 Our idea is called pickup it, 
 we are using Watson to explore 
 the area of (unknown term). 
 In our show, 
 our idea is to make an application  they can choose
 the best photo 
 collection and by using Watson  machine learning,
 we will train 
 based on simple aesthetic decisions 
 and good photography practice and  principles.
 And we hope 
 that could help users 
 to make photo selection 
 efficiently and effectively. 
 
 The basic task for (unknown term)  is to take a collection of photos,
 and identify, based on a few simple  principles of photography, which 
ones are particularly good or bad.  So that protection would be that 
given a photo, given a score whether  it is good or bad. Judgement wise,
 to sex or failure is whether he  picked a good photo for you
 but the false negative, when it  fails to identify which photos are
... 
 A lot of things take a photo good  other than just
 contrast 
 and being in focus, 
 there are creative elements 
 so this just helps with making sure  it is not blurry
 in the contrast is set. 
 So this could highlight either the  best photo or bad photos in the 
collection.  Outcome wise, because it is all
 baseline (unknown term), it is hard  to tell what is a good photo
 so we would be hoping to evaluate  based on these criteria.
 Training wise, we are hoping to use  supervised training where the model 
will be given photos and once we  establish a set of rules that we 
want to train it by, photos that  follow those rules very well and 
once I do not.  We are hoping to find open Vos 
source photos and once from  ourselves.
 And feedback would be to update  based on user satisfaction so 
basically, does it feel good for the  user?did they go back and find a 
bunch of photos for the system to  identify or does the system keep 
spitting out photos that it says are  good but to actual humans, are bad.
 On the base level, we are hoping it  will save time for photographers and 
baselevel social media users.  But if it ends up working really 
well, we can see this integrating  with other services. So right now, 
most iPhones have a burst photo  option and usually most of those are 
bad.  But over a period time,
 taking a really good picture and on  the opposite end, if you are taking 
really bad pictures than you could  see it being integrated with 
People's cloud storage and helping  people manage their storage without 

 We kind of talks about what the app  does but I will talk about the 
business side of things.  So the customer is just like an 
average, amateur photographer or  social media using individual.
 And the benefit of the app is that  it
 reduces stress in taking a picture,  it can be personalized
 based on (unknown term) on the  selected photos,
 and also it will have transparent  selection criteria.
 So the user will know that their  photo is getting picked
 because it uses the rule of thirds  really well
 or the composition is good, or the  contrast.
 So this is valuable because systems  like this aren't really typically
 available to individuals. 
 There are companies like 
 (unknown term) Hudson 
 that have these huge machine  learning systems and subscriptions
 can cost in the $4000 a month range, 
 for companies to use, 
 but tools like this 
 don't really exist right 
 for individuals so that is our  niche.
 We can measure success based on the  volume of use,
 like how many photos are  reprocessing.
 The user could measure success  based on success of their photos
 selected on social media 
 or by watching the machine learn  about their preferences over time.
 Referrals could happen through  word-of-mouth,
 through discount or incentivize  referrals,
. 
 So like we will process 100 more  photos for free
 if someone signs up using this  link, kind of thing.
 
 So, how are we using Watson to  create these apps?
 The main service we are going to be  using his Watson ML, the visual 
recognition service.  And how we are going to judge of the 
photo is good or not is a  combination of classifiers that we 
are going to make.  So for instance, do we see a picture 
of a redeye refection or does the  image quality look good, does it 
follow the rule of threes?  The input will be from the camera or 
from your photo library, if given  consent, and we are hoping to create 
an aesthetic score which is  basically a combination of the 
classifiers detected on your photos.  So either out of a score of five or 
100, we are going to tell you how  good the photo is for general 
purpose.  And hopefully give you suggestions 
for whether you can use a durum  photo or what you can do to make it 
better.  That is our proposal and I would 
 Very cool. I believe we 
spoke before about visual  recognition being no more

 The services enfolded into Watson  ML, you can just added in the ML 
service.  So it is all operational, as before. 
 Good, good, good. 
 Looking forward to that. 
 Very nice, niche placement in the  business there.
 Some sort of personalization 
 because good today might not want  blurry,
 but goods 
 guys sport tomorrow might want  blurry
. 
 Alright, we gotta run here. 
 That was team nine and now we have  team 10.
 Go ahead. 
 
 We are group 10 
 and we are creating a dashboard 
 that can be used for 
 by equity and fixed-income traders  on the market to view daily market 
sentiment, and live headlines so  they can make informed decisions on 
the fly.  Why is it better than the 
alternative?  Traders need the fastest information 
possible and current alternatives 
 that any use can be complex and  time-consuming, so we decided to 
make a simpler solution. 
 It will help you will because it  scans market news by industry and 
displays S-CORP based on current  sentiment on that market
 for that industry.  It will also display live headlines
 for events, so it will be  constantly scanning news.
 It will be letting traders know  what is happening on the fly. It 
will scan hundreds of articles that  would be very time consuming for 
traders to read on their own, so we  are having a I do this for them so 
they can focus more on their job and  less on what is happening in the 
news.  Traders about the equity and fixed 
income markets.  will use it. It could be like a free 
premium subtractions service, there  could be free basic usage and then 
you could subscribe and have some  premium features.
 For those who some scribe, we would  also receive money from there.
 
 The product timeline we are planning 
 -- or the ideal formulated 
 and also building a product, 
 and we will have data testing 
 in July 2021. 
 In August 2021, 
 we are going to launch the product. 
 So the delivery method 
 for this product will be the  (unknown term)
 as well as 
 a real-time stock prices, 
 so that the traders or users can  compare
 the market sentiment 
 with the stock price. 
 The success metric for us 
 is measured by daily active users 
 and monthly active users. 
 The paying customers versus  nonpaying customers, and also the 
customer sharing.  How long the customer is going to 
stay with us in our services.  Some of the known difficulties
, it really depends on the accuracy  and how good the news article is.
 Because some of the market articles  are generated
 -- automatically generated 
 and provide very few values 
 and we need to filter those out. 
 The data source, 
 we are going to use the (unknown  term) API
 for the stock market price 
 and we are also going to use the  IBM discovery corpus
 to analyse the sentiments. 
 
 I'm going to provide a very quick  recap
 on basically our project. 
 We are 
 tracking one of the same types of  markets as (unknown term),
 which is that with Robin Hood and a  bunch of new apps,
 we see an influx of not  sophisticated traders.
 They do not have access to pricing  information services and of course,
 they have to make lots of decisions  without lots of training.
 So we are trying to provide a  product that will be able to help 
these people make better choices.  And as we saw especially with game 
stop or does coin in the crypto  space recently, a lot of the market 
swings these days are based off  of-media attention.
 Our product will be able to  encapsulate some of those changes.
 Our prediction is industry by  industry headlines and sentiments 
course.  And we will be able to
 generate these on different  timelines
 to be able to give this information  to the user.
 We hope to also have a history of  sentiment scores,
 so you will be able to trace like  what days crypto
 was for example really hot in the  news and what days it wasn't.
 And we will also be able to  incorporate stock prices using the
 Yahoo API to be able to compare and  see how the sentiments actually 
affect the market.  And we believe that this is an 
unexplored market,.  This interest in Robin Hood
 and non-sophisticated traders is  really new
 and we believe we are tackling a  new slice of the market.
 Call. 
 There are a lot of 
 new people out there 
 who are disappearing on buses  weekly as they appear sometimes.
 That was team 10, thank you very  much.
 I'm really interested in (unknown  term),
 it reminds me of chemistry. 
 Go ahead. 
 
 Hello. 
 Our team's goal 
 is to essentially make it easier 
 to perform calculation 
 in both an academic setting 
 and a professional setting. 
, 
 with regard to 
 chemistry and physical operations. 
 Because often times the issue that  you run into,
 is that you know all of the  variables
 and you know exactly what it is you  want to solve for
 but it takes valuable time and  effort to actually execute all of it
, when it is really just a very  common sequence of steps
 that humans don't really need to be  able to do.
 Questions that we have here, such  as how many moles of carbon dioxide
 does it take to output four moles  of glucose in photosynthesis?
 I'm sure pretty much everyone here  has heard of this reaction,
 but if you go to (unknown term)  which is supposed to be the 
authority on this, it just does not  understand. So our goal is to be 
able to deal with these kinds of  situations.
 We are trying to predict the  correct calculation
 and formulas to apply 
 producing results where possible. 
 Specifically, 
 we are trying to look 
 for areas with multiple different  important inputs
, like the one strata before 
 where you have 
 several different compounds and  variables that you want to assign 
them to. 
 Certain systems are not able to  handle that degree of complexity

 Basically, 
 there are not too many consequences 
 or the gain isn't too huge if we  are right.
 They save a little bit of time 
 if they give a consistent  unreliable answer
 that if we are wrong, there is a  significant cost.
 They might accidentally mix the  wrong to ingredients and producing 
noxious gas or something.  You do not want to cause those sort 
of issues.  So we do have to be careful about 
false positives and false negatives.  Further, next our outcome
 will be measured basically by  looking at user interaction with a 
bot.  Seeing if they kept going down the 
rate area and if they got a solution, 
 or did they choose that this was no. 
 For input, we will be using  annotated inputs provided by Watson
 so we will be able to identify  numbers
 as well as the units that are  applied to them if we do things 
carefully.  Using that information, we will then 
be able to do \'96 either through Watson 
 \'96 set up these equations that we  were talking about and hopefully get 
to a place where we are able to  produce chemical results.
 In training, we will need a  significant number of these sample 
queries that are asking the same  questions that (Name) covered.
 If we are able to have those along  with the variables that are 
important, their units and the  expect of results, we think that we 
should be able to work towards a  good working model. And then finally 
feedback will look like when  multiple options are presented,
 we will try to bias towards the  most commonly selected answers in 
the past.  Say we were not able to figure out 
the exact equation that you are  looking for but we had several ideas,
 whichever idea people had chosen in  the past was commonly, we will bias 
towards that.  That is just one example of feedback.
 The impact of our program 
 is to make the job 
 faster and easier for people. 
 But people still need to know 
 how to 
 input the correct queries. 
 On the business side, 
 our pick 
 program could potentially down 
 size the company. 
 And our programs, 
 so best case 
 our programs will be about 
 (unknown term) use or how to 
 correct their inputs on the spot. 
 Very cool. 
 Collecting the input may be a  challenge
 but very nice 
 and a very new idea, I like that. 
 Wish I had had a long time ago. 
 Alright, last but not least \'96 
 group 12. 
 
 Hi everyone. 
 What we came up with 
 was currently in America and across  the world,
 mental illness is a large issue. 
 A lot of places, people do not have  resources for mental illness
 but also a big issue is even if 
 spaces where they do have the  resources of therapy,
 it is really hard to tell when  someone is struggling.
 This is a challenge that I have  been working on at Dartmouth for a 
couple of years now and it is one  thing that I thought of \'96 what is 
one thing that someone needs to be  able to tell that you're going 
through something?  What if we had a bot that is 
continuously messaging the men  messages you are sending our social 
media and can figure out when you're  feeling down or having nude swings 
-- mood swings.  It could intervene at these key 
moments to make your reflector  provide some resources that can help 
you and this is proactive, which  means nothing from the user. So the 
yes symbol, we hook up a bot that  hooks up to your social media and 
kind of continuously reads and  monitors your social messages. And 
whenever it feels like you're going  through a downward spiral, you are 
getting angry or emotional, HSN zero  message to ask you to reflect on why
. 
 We will quickly render the AI canvas 
. 
 
 For production, 
 our app is looking to predict two  things in particular.
 First of all 
 if we want to predict when a user  is in a negative state of mind
 and is in need of intervention and  assistance, and the other thing we 
want to predict 
 is to get the user reinforcements  if they are showing improvements.

 When it comes to judgements, we  note that our primary goal is to 
provide help to users. 
 It is a secondary goal of ours to  reinforce a semblance of happiness 
to have users but given our primary  goal, it is our aim to minimize 
false positives and her predictions.  That is to minimize the number of 
users that are unhappy but are  perceived or understood to be happy 
by our app, so that we make sure to  have all unhappy users.
 That you actions that are  Apple take
 his first to ping and nudge the mute 
 user in a secondary function would  be to generate a weekly report
 to summarize the sentiments that  the user experience.
 In terms of outcome, we can use the  F1 storm in terms of metrics
 to measure the AI models  performance.
 We can also have an optional survey  to gain feedback from the user
 were guarding their spirits of  using the app.
 Regarding training, 
 to train Watson 
 we hope to use a supervised approach 
 where we harness in 
 pre-existing 
 large, training data set containing  example post.
 Ideally, we would use a corpus of  Twitter posts
 in each post would have a  predefined label
 of sentiment. 
 Watson to an extent comes with 
 some 
 pretraining for natural language  tasks
 and especially we were to use 
 Watson ML you service, 
. 
 To test Watson, 
 we would look at a bunch of unseen  Twitter posts
, unseen so that the AI cannot make 
 cheats on how the user is feeling. 
 Regarding input, 
 we will handle the users 
 data from a Twitter 
 and present the user from  encouraging messengers
 for communication purposes, 
 and make sure that there is some  variation in the messages
 to the user. 
 We would not want to bore them with  the same messages
 As for feedback,
 we would depend on feedback  provided by users
 to optional surveys. 
 Things like what frequency of  encouragements and reinforcements
 are more useful to them, 
. 
 At a later stage, be able to  consider input from experts like 
professional psychotherapists and so  forth regarding user surveys and app 
user instructions that were approved  for sharing by users to further 

 What we are really hoping to do 
 is it catching issues 
 before they snowball, we want to  use Watson MOU
 and a powerful thing is sentiment  analysis.
 We would not just say that we know  you are a feeling Saturday,
 we would say that you were talking  to (Name) about an upcoming promotion
 and you seem to be angry about  that, maybe you want to reflect and 
wonder why it is making you angry.  The point is to continue
 helping them without ever lifting a  finger to figure them out. Our plan 
comes down to, our rough draft is  going to be a (unknown term)
 but our eventual business model is  an app on your phone
 which you hook up to all of your  social media which I continuously 
mutters.  The first question that comes up is 
privacy, we realize how crazy it  sounds. When it comes to this model,
 we put monetization prices  side-by-side. The model we want to 
use as a subscription model where  the user is asked to be recorded and 
we say they are not selling their  data to anyone. We do realize with 
these types of apps, we want to give  a longer data -- demo
 so I can help them get in.  Then they can purchase add-ons or 
additional social media features.  We would love it if the users share 
their data with us but again we  don't want to be a pricey first app 
and it will often be data sharing,  the data will be used to improve the 
 This can make such 
an impact.  This is really cool. Did you say you 
 Yes and no.
 For the actual sentiment analysis,  you don't need to train data from 
(unknown term). 
 You can look at positive and  negative Twitter posts,
 a lot of the problems is just  narrowing down the (unknown term).
 And it is not a conversation bought 
, like Replika? 
 And privacy first, thank you. 
 The only other comment was 
 user feedback, asking a user 
 if they were depressed last week,  you may not get a good answer 
(Laughs) I don't know. 
 **Audio lost** 
 
 What a crop of fun, this is great  guys and gals.
 And dogs and cats, if you have them. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Great attendance and great projects, 
 I am looking forward to it. 
 This should be a blast. 
 Sorry we are running late. 
 Wednesday, we have our last guest  speaker for the year
 and on Friday, 
 we have our last chapter review for  the year.
